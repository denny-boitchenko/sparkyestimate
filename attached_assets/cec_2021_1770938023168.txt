CSA C22.1:21 Canadian Electrical Code, Part I

Preface
This twenty-fifth edition of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I, was approved by the Committee on the
Canadian Electrical Code, Part I, and by the Regulatory Authority Committee at their June 2020
meetings. This twenty-fifth edition supersedes the previous editions, published in 2018, 2015, 2012,
2009, 2006, 2002, 1998, 1994, 1990, 1986, 1982, 1978, 1975, 1972, 1969, 1966, 1962, 1958, 1953,
1947, 1939, 1935, 1930, and 1927.

This edition contains important revisions to many Sections. Section 64 features a new Subsection
governing installation of energy storage systems and Rules for functionally-grounded renewable energy
systems. Several important changes appear in Section 26, including a new requirement for ground fault
circuit interrupter protection for all 15 A and 20 A receptacles located outdoors within 2.5 m of grade.

New requirements in support of climate change adaptation appear in several Sections of the Code.
Section 22 now contains a new Subsection for farm buildings housing livestock, as well as revised Rules
for equipment in Category 1 and 2 locations.

Other significant revisions in this edition include the following:
• redundant or out-of-date requirements, such as the Rules for open wiring, have been removed;
• the definition for “Voltage — Low voltage” has been revised in Section 0;
• clarification has been provided on impedance grounded system operation under fault condition in

Section 10;
• new requirements for electrical equipment installed near roof decking systems have been added in

Section 12;
• load calculations and equipment layout for recreational vehicle lots have been updated in

Section 72;
• Table 19 has been completely reorganized, simplified, and shortened;
• Annexes A.1 and A.2 of Appendix A have been removed and are now hosted online;
• Appendix E has been deleted; and
• the Index has been deleted in conformance with CSA Group’s drafting and editorial requirements.

Many of the changes in this edition were developed by cross-functional working groups. Their work is
gratefully acknowledged.

General arrangement
The Code is divided into numbered Sections, each covering some main division of the work. Sections 0
to 16 and 26 are considered general Sections, and the other Sections supplement or amend the general
Sections. The Sections are divided into numbered Rules, with captions for easy reference, as follows:
a) Numbering system — With the exception of Section 38, even numbers have been used throughout

to identify Sections and Rules. Rule numbers consist of the Section number separated by a hyphen
from the 3- or 4-digit figure. The intention in general is that odd numbers may be used for new
Rules required by interim revisions. Due to the introduction of some new Rules and the deletion of
some existing Rules during the revision of each edition, the Rule numbers for any particular
requirement are not always the same in successive editions.

b) Subdivision of Rules — Rules are subdivided in the manner illustrated by Rules 8-204 and 8-206,
and the subdivisions are identified as follows:

00-000 Rule
1) Subrule

a) Item
i) Item

A) Item

c) Reference to other Rules, etc. — Where reference is made to two or more Rules (e.g.,
Rules 10-200 to 10-206), the first and last Rules mentioned are included in the reference. Where
reference is made to a Subrule or Item in the same Rule, only the Subrule number and/or Item
letter and the word “Subrule” or “Item” need be mentioned. If the reference is to another Rule or
Section, then the Rule number and the word “Rule” shall be stated [e.g., “Rule 10-206 3)” and not
“Subrule 3) of Rule 10-206”].

The principal changes that have been made between the 2018 edition of the Canadian Electrical Code,
Part I, and this new edition, published in 2021, are marked in the text of the Code by the symbol delta
(Δ) in the margin. Users of the Code are advised that the change markers in the text are not intended to
be all-inclusive and are provided as a convenience only; such markers cannot constitute a
comprehensive guide to the reorganization or revision of the Code. Global revisions that improve the
overall consistency and precision of Code language without affecting the interpretation of any specific
Rule are not identified. Care must therefore be taken not to rely on the change markers to determine
the current requirements of the Code. As always, users of the Code must consider the entire Code and
any local amendments or interpretations.

This Code has been developed in compliance with Standards Council of Canada requirements for
National Standards of Canada. It has been published as a National Standard of Canada by CSA Group.

Acknowledgement
The use of material contained in the National Electrical Code is acknowledged.

The history and operation of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I
The preliminary work in preparing the Canadian Electrical Code began in 1920 when a special
committee, appointed by the main Committee of the Canadian Engineering Standards Association,
recommended its development. A third meeting of this Committee was held in June 1927 with
representatives from Nova Scotia, Québec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia in
attendance. At this meeting, the revised draft, which had been discussed at the previous two meetings,
was formally approved and it was resolved that it be printed as Part I of the Canadian Electrical Code.

The Committee on the CE Code, Part I, is composed of 43 members, with representation from
inspection authorities, industry, utilities, and allied interests. The main Committee meets once a year
and deals with reports that have been submitted by the Section Subcommittees, which work under the
jurisdiction of the main Committee. Suggestions for changes to the Code may be made by any member
of the Committee or anyone outside the Committee as outlined in Clause C6.
Notes:
1) Although the intended primary application of this Code is stated in its Scope, it is important to note that it

remains the responsibility of the users of the Code to judge its suitability for their particular purpose.
2) This Code is subject to review within five years from the date of publication, and suggestions for its

improvement will be referred to the appropriate committee.
3) All enquiries regarding this Code should be addressed to CSA Group, 178 Rexdale Blvd., Toronto, Ontario,

Canada M9W 1R3. Requests for interpretation should be worded in such a manner as to permit a specific
“yes” or “no” answer based on the literal text of the requirement concerned. See Clause C9. Interpretations
are available on the Current Standards Activities page at standardsactivities.csa.ca.

CSA C22.1:21 Object, scope, and definitions

Section 0 — Object, scope, and definitions
(See Appendix G)

Object (see Appendix B)
The object of this Code is to establish safety standards for the installation and maintenance of electrical
equipment. In its preparation, consideration has been given to the prevention of fire and shock hazards,
as well as proper maintenance and operation.

The requirements in this Code address the fundamental principles of protection for safety contained in
Section 131 of International Electrotechnical Commission Standard 60364-1, Low-voltage electrical
installations. IEC 60364-1, Section 131, contains fundamental principles of protection for safety that
encompass protection against electric shock, thermal effects, overcurrent, fault currents, and
overvoltage. Therefore, compliance with the requirements of this Code and proper maintenance will
ensure an essentially safe installation. Safe installations may be also achieved by alternatives to this
Code, when such alternatives meet the fundamental safety principles of IEC 60364-1 (see Appendix K).
These alternatives are intended to be used only in conjunction with acceptable means to assess
compliance of these alternatives with the fundamental safety principles of IEC 60364-1 by the
authorities enforcing this Code.

Wiring installations that do not make provision for the increasing use of electricity may be overloaded in
the future, resulting in a hazardous condition. It is recommended that the initial installation have
sufficient wiring capacity and that there be some provision made for wiring changes that might be
required as a result of future load growth.

This Code is not intended as a design specification nor as an instruction manual for untrained persons.

Scope
This Code applies to all electrical work and electrical equipment operating or intended to operate at all
voltages in electrical installations for buildings, structures, and premises, including factory-built
relocatable and non-relocatable structures, and self-propelled marine vessels stationary for periods
exceeding five months and connected to a shore supply of electricity continuously or from time to time,
with the following exceptions:
a) installations or equipment employed by an electric, communication, or community antenna

distribution system utility in the exercise of its function as a utility, as recognized by the regulatory
authority having jurisdiction, and located outdoors or in buildings or sections of buildings used for
that purpose;

b) equipment and facilities that are used in the operation of an electric railway and are supplied
exclusively from circuits that supply the motive power;

c) installations or equipment used for railway signalling and railway communication purposes, and
located outdoors or in buildings or sections of buildings used exclusively for such installations;

d) aircraft; and
e) electrical systems in ships that are regulated under Transport Canada.

For mines and quarry applications, see also CSA M421.

This Code and any standards referenced in it do not make or imply any assurance or guarantee by the
authority adopting this Code with respect to life expectancy, durability, or operating performance of
equipment and materials so referenced.

‡ These are maximum allowable conductor temperatures for one, two, or three insulated conductors run in a raceway, or two or
three insulated conductors run in a cable, and may be used in determining the ampacity of other conductor types listed in
Table 19, which are so run, as follows: From Table 19 determine the maximum allowable conductor insulation temperature for
that particular type, then from this Table determine the ampacity under the column of corresponding temperature rating.
§ See Rule 14-104 2).
** For mineral-insulated cables, these ratings are based on the use of 90 °C insulation on the emerging conductors and for
sealing. Where a deviation has been allowed in accordance with Rule 2-030, mineral-insulated cable may be used at a higher
temperature without a decrease in the allowable ampacity, provided that the insulation, sealing material, and any jacketing
material are suitable for the higher temperature.
†† See Table 5C for the correction factors to be applied to the values in Columns 2 to 7 where there are more than three
insulated conductors in a run of raceway or cable.

Notes:
1) The ampacity values are based on a single isolated cable in air at an ambient temperature of 30 °C. For cables operating at a different ambient air

temperature, the ampacity shall be obtained by multiplying the appropriate value from this Table by the correction factor for that other ambient
temperature, as contained in Table 12B.

2) The ampacities are based on a conductor insulation temperature of 90 °C. For conductor insulation temperatures other than 90 °C, the ampacity of a
given insulated conductor type shall be obtained by multiplying the appropriate value from this Table by the correction factor for that conductor
insulation temperature as contained in Table 12C.

3) When cables are used with one or more layers wound on a drum, the actual internal temperature of the cable can exceed the 90 °C rating. Thermal
overheating may shorten the run life of the cable. The appropriate ampacity correction factors are shown in Table 12D.

4) For single-conductor cables with metallic shields, the ampacity values are for cables operated with an open-circuit shield.

Notes:
1) The ampacity values are based on a single isolated cable in air at an ambient temperature of 30 °C. For cables

operating at a different ambient temperature, the ampacity shall be obtained by multiplying the appropriate
value from this Table by the correction factor for that ambient temperature as given in Table 12B.

2) The ampacity values are based on a conductor insulation temperature of 90 °C. For conductor insulation
temperatures other than 90 °C, the ampacity of a given insulated conductor type shall be obtained by
multiplying the appropriate value from this Table by the correction factor for that insulation conductor
temperature as given in Table 12C.

3) When cables are used with more tray layers, the appropriate correction factors are shown in Table 5D.

a) Rules J18-054 2) and J18-054 3) for Class II; and
b) Rule J18-054 4) for Class III.

Group IIIA equipment is not suitable for use in Class II locations.
** Equipment marked with these types of protection is available in multiple levels of protection that are not specifically identified within the Ex
marking.
†† The EPL takes precedence over the type of protection; for example, “Ex ia Gb” is suitable for Zone 1 (not Zone 0), “Ex op is Db” is suitable for
Zone 21 (not Zone 20), and “Ex 60079-30-1 Gc is suitable for Zone 2 (not Zone 1). Selection according to the marked EPL is critical to the safe
application of this equipment.
‡‡ In Class III, Division 1, switches, controllers, circuit breakers, fuses, control transformers, resistors, utilization equipment (fixed and portable),
electric cranes, hoists, and similar equipment may be housed in Enclosure Type 5.
Note: This Table is structured to show the area classification on the left side and the permitted equipment on the
right side. Zone equipment is suitable for use in some Class/Division locations and vice versa. This is indicated by
the phrase “Equipment suitable for use in...”. For example, in Class I, Division 1 locations, “Equipment suitable for
use in Zone 0” means all equipment listed under Zone 0 can be used.

Notes:
1) These values of motor full load current are to be used as guides only. Where exact values are required (e.g., for motor protection), always use the values

on the motor nameplate.
2) These values of motor full load current are for motors running at speeds typical for belted motors and motors with normal torque characteristics. Motors

built for especially low speeds or high torques may require more running current, and multi-speed motors have full load current varying with speed, in
which case the nameplate current ratings shall be used.

3) For 90 and 80% power factor, multiply the values in this Table by 1.1 and 1.25, respectively.
4) The voltages listed are rated motor voltages. Corresponding nominal system voltages are 120, 208, 240, 480, and 600 V. Refer to CSA C235.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Section 0
Object
The safety provisions of this Code are not intended to limit installation methods to those specifically
described by the Rules in this Code. The safety objectives of this Code may be met by utilizing
alternative installation methods based on the fundamental safety principles of IEC 60364-1.

Such alternative methods are intended only for industrial and similar installations where objective-
based installation criteria are addressed under the provisions of safety management systems or
equivalent programs developed between users (industrial plants, independent power producers, etc.)
and the authorities adopting and enforcing this Code.

Chapter 13 of IEC 60364-1 offers the fundamental safety principles and is included in Appendix K.

Δ Ampacity
See Clause C11.10 in Appendix C.

Δ Approved
It is intended by this definition that electrical equipment installed under provisions of this Code is
required to be certified to the applicable CSA product Standards as listed in Appendix A. Where such
CSA Standards do not exist or are not applicable, it is intended by this definition that such electrical
equipment be certified to other applicable Standards, such as ULC Standards. Code users should be
aware that fire alarm system equipment is deemed to be approved when it is certified to the applicable
product Standards listed in CAN/ULC-S524.

This definition is also intended to reflect the fact that equipment approval could be accomplished via a
field evaluation procedure in conformance with CSA Model Code SPE-1000 or, for medical electrical
equipment, CSA Model Code SPE-3000, where special inspection bodies are recognized by participating
provincial and territorial authorities having jurisdiction. For new products that are not available at the
time this Code is adopted, the authority having jurisdiction may permit the use of products that comply
with the requirements set out by that jurisdiction.

Cablebus
Cablebus is ordinarily assembled at the point of installation from the components furnished or specified
by the manufacturer in accordance with instructions for the specific job. This assembly is designed to
carry fault current and to withstand the magnetic forces of such current.

Circuit
For the purposes of this Code, a circuit is generally considered to mean the portion of a wiring
installation that is connected to the load side terminals of an ac or dc system and that forms a complete
path or paths through which electrical current is normally intended to flow, including utilization
equipment. For example, a cable connecting the load side terminals of a three-phase circuit breaker up
to and including utilization equipment is generally considered to be a circuit, as would be a similar
3-wire single-phase installation.

Δ Explosion-proof enclosure
Explosion-proof fittings, unions, couplings, reducers, elbows, seals, glands, plugs, and other similar
devices are also considered part of the enclosure, and are used to maintain the explosion-proof
integrity of the enclosure and other connected explosion-proof equipment.

Δ Flood elevation
It is intended by this definition to recognize that a flood elevation is designated in accordance with
provisions of the provincial or territorial building codes, local building or zoning regulations, or local
flood-proofing policies. A flood elevation corresponds to a flood hazard zone and may be driven by

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

rivers surpassing their banks, precipitation exceeding storm water capacity, ice jamming, sea level rise,
and storm surging. Flood elevations are typically measured in metres above a datum such as mean sea
level and are typically associated with a return period event (e.g., a 1 in 100 year event).

Δ Flood hazard zone
It is intended by this definition to recognize that a flood hazard zone is designated in accordance with
provisions of the provincial or territorial building codes, local building or zoning regulations, or local
flood-proofing policies. Flood hazards may be driven by rivers surpassing their banks, precipitation
exceeding storm water capacity, ice jamming, sea level rise, and storm surging. Various terminology is
used to define flood hazard zones, including floodplains, floodways, and flood fringes. Maps may be
available in some jurisdictions to define floodplains corresponding to a certain return period event (e.g.,
a 1 in 100 year event).

Ground fault circuit interrupter, Class A (Class A GFCI)
A Class A ground fault circuit interrupter (Class A GFCI) is an interrupter that will interrupt the circuit to
the load when the ground fault current is 6 mA or more, but not when the ground fault current is
4 mA* or less in a time
a) not greater than that given by the equation

where
T is in seconds; and
I is the ground fault current in rms milliamperes for fault currents between 4 mA and 260 mA; and

b) not greater than 25 ms for ground fault currents over 260 mA.
* When the ambient air temperature is less than –5 °C or more than 40 °C, the minimum tripping current may be
3.5 mA instead of 4.

In addition, a Class A GFCI is to be capable of interrupting the circuit to the load, in keeping with the
above requirements, if the identified circuit conductor (neutral) becomes inadvertently grounded
between the interrupter and the load.

The prime function of a Class A GFCI is to provide protection against hazardous electric shocks from
leakage current flowing to ground from defective circuits or equipment. It does not provide protection
against shock if a person makes contact with two of the circuit conductors on the load side of the GFCI.

Class A GFCIs are marked “GROUND FAULT CIRCUIT INTERRUPTER CLASS A” or with an abbreviated form
such as “GFCI CL A”, “GFCI A”, or “CL A” where the area available for marking makes the complete text
impracticable.

Ground fault detection
Ground fault detection devices (or devices and remote current sensors making up a detection system)
are devices that detect a ground fault and provide an indication or alarm, or both, that a ground fault
has been detected. They do not necessarily control or interrupt ground fault current and are therefore
not considered a form of ground fault protection.

Ground fault protection
Ground fault detection devices that indicate a ground fault but do not control or interrupt ground fault
current are not considered a form of ground fault protection.

Users of this Code should refer to Canadian Electrical Code, Part II Standards for design, construction,
and performance requirements for each particular type of ground fault protection mandated by this
Code.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Grounding conductor
It is intended that the grounding conductor will terminate on the enclosure for the service box or
protective devices supplying the system in cases where the system is not grounded, and at the internal
bus for the grounded conductor where the system is grounded.

Δ Hazardous location
In this definition, “special precautions” refers to the special features of electrical equipment design,
installation, and use that are intended to prevent the equipment from igniting flammable vapours, dust,
fibres, or flyings. See Section 18 for more specific requirements for hazardous locations.

While this definition refers to electrical equipment, hazardous location area classifications take into
account non-electrical equipment such as stationary engines, fired heaters, and all other potentially
ignition-capable equipment, whether or not it is electrical, which may be installed or used in such areas.

Ladder cable tray
Although a single-rail cable tray by definition is not a ladder cable tray, it is subject to the same
performance requirements as a ladder-type cable tray in CSA C22.2 No. 126.1 (NEMA VE 1).

Mobile home
The following is the complete definition of mobile home given in CAN/CSA-Z240.0.1 in the CAN/CSA-
Z240 MH Series:

Mobile home — a transportable, single- or multiple-section single family dwelling conforming to the
CAN/CSA-Z240 MH Series at time of manufacture. It is ready for occupancy upon completion of set-
up in accordance with required factory-recommended installation instructions.

Mobile industrial or commercial structure
Such structures are built specifically for commercial or industrial use, such as construction offices,
bunkhouses, wash houses, kitchen and dining units, libraries, TV units, industrial display units,
laboratory units, and medical clinics.

Neutral
By definition, a neutral conductor of a circuit requires at least three conductors in that circuit. However,
in the trade, the term “neutral conductor” is commonly applied to the conductor of a 2-wire circuit that
is connected to a conductor grounded at the supply end. Care should therefore be taken in the use of
this term when applying the Code.

Non-combustible construction
The specific details for buildings of non-combustible construction are provided in Part 3 of the National
Building Code of Canada.

Outdoor location
Locations that are sheltered from the weather are not considered outdoor locations.

Park model trailer
The following is the complete definition of park model trailer given in CAN/CSA-Z241:

Park model trailer — a recreational vehicle unit that meets the following criteria:
a) it is built on a single chassis mounted on wheels;
b) it is designed to facilitate relocation from time to time;
c) it is designed as living quarters for seasonal camping and may be connected to those utilities

necessary for operation of installed fixtures and appliances; and

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 540



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

d) it has a gross floor area, including lofts, not exceeding 50 m2 when in the set-up mode, and
having a width greater than 2.6 m in the transit mode.

Recreational vehicle
The following is the complete definition of recreational vehicle given in CAN/CSA-Z240.0.2 in the
CAN/CSA-Z240 RV Series:

Recreational vehicle — a structure designed to provide temporary living accommodation for travel,
vacation, or recreational use and to be driven, towed, or transported. Except for fifth-wheel trailers,
it has an overall length not exceeding 12.5 m and an overall width not exceeding 2.6 m, where the
width is the sum of the distances from the vehicle centreline to the outermost projections on each
side. These dimensions exclude safety-related equipment such as side safety and warning lights and
entry and exit handholds. Also excluded are water spray suppression attachments, load-induced tire
bulge, and equipment used to secure cargo on a vehicle. These excluded items are allowed to
extend not more than 100 mm when the vehicle is folded or stowed for transit. For a fifth-wheel
trailer the maximum overall length is 11.3 m taken from the rear extremity to the front of the main
body, measured at the floorline. Such structures include travel trailers, slide-in campers, camping
trailers, motor homes, and fifth-wheel trailers:

Camping trailer — a recreational vehicle built on its own chassis, having a rigid or canvas top
and side walls, that may be folded or otherwise stowed for transit and that is designed to be
towed behind a motor vehicle.

Fifth-wheel trailer — a recreational vehicle designed to be coupled to the towing vehicle by a
fifth-wheel-type coupler, through which a substantial part of the trailer weight is supported by
the towing vehicle.

Motor home — a recreational vehicle that is self-propelled. For purposes of applying the
CAN/CSA-Z240 RV Series, this includes a van conversion containing at least one
a) plumbing fixture;
b) fuel-burning appliance; or
c) 120 V electrical component.

Slide-in camper — a recreational vehicle designed to be loaded onto and unloaded from the
bed of a pick-up truck.

Travel trailer — a recreational vehicle designed to be towed behind a motor vehicle by means
of a bumper or frame hitch.

Service box
This definition does not require that an electrically operated switch or circuit breaker be capable of
being externally operable by hand to the closed position.

Supply authority
These bodies are sometimes referred to as electric utilities, wire owners, local distribution companies,
municipal utilities, distributors, transmitters, etc. Some supply authorities may own and operate
electrical power production facilities as part of their electrical power network operations and be
deemed to be utilities by the regulatory authority having jurisdiction. Refer to Section 0, Scope, Item a)
for the regulation of utilities.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

System
Within this Code, the word “system” is used in many different contexts. However, within the context of
electrical power distribution, a system is intended to mean an electrical installation in which the energy
provided by that installation to utilization equipment is derived from a single energy source. For
example, an electrical installation supplied from a transformer or bank of transformers can be
considered a system; an installation supplied from a different transformer would be considered a
different system.

Δ Ventilated cable tray
Ventilated cable tray includes wire mesh cable tray.

Δ Voltage
Unless otherwise specified, ac voltages are expressed throughout this Code as the root-mean-square
voltage values in a sinusoidal 60 Hz system, and dc voltages represent steady-state maximum nominal
voltage values.

Section 2
Δ Rule 2-024 1)

It is intended by this Subrule to emphasize that only electrical equipment approved for the application
should be used under the provisions of this Code. “Approved” is a defined term that includes
certification of electrical equipment to the applicable product Standards or other means that conform
to the requirements of the regulatory authority.

For the purpose of this Subrule, the phrase “shall be of a kind or type and rating approved for the
specific purpose for which it is to be employed” is also intended to include the suitability of electrical
equipment for the environment in which it will be located.

Code users should be aware that when electrical equipment is subjected to field modification by means
other than an approved field installable kit, such modification may void the original approval of the
equipment. Thus, it is also intended by this Subrule that upon completion of any field modification that
voids the original approval of the equipment, the equipment should be made approved in accordance
with provisions of the regulatory authority (i.e., in accordance with CSA Model Code SPE-1000 or other
programs accepted by the participating regulatory authority).
Rule 2-026
As a condition of approval of certain types of electrical equipment, the manufacturer supplies
instructions pertaining to its installation. It is of the utmost importance that the installer closely follow
installation instructions supplied by the manufacturer to fulfill the terms of the approval agreement.

Δ Rule 2-032 3)
The intent of this Subrule is that equipment subjected to the adverse impact of water be evaluated by
an organization that is acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction for compliance with the applicable
safety Standards to which the equipment was originally approved. The following should be consulted
for specific recommendations:

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Δ Rule 2-130
The flame spread requirements for insulated conductors and cables installed with exposed outer
combustible insulation or jackets in buildings are located in the National Building Code of Canada as
follows:
a) combustible building construction — Article 3.1.4.3 and Article 9.34.1.5;
b) non-combustible building construction — Article 3.1.5.21; and
c) plenum spaces in buildings — Article 3.6.4.3.

The markings for conductors and cables meeting the flame spread requirements of the National
Building Code of Canada (i.e., for conductors and cables installed with exposed outer combustible
insulation or jackets) are
a) FT1* — insulated conductors and cables that are suitable for installation in buildings of

combustible construction;
b) FT4† — insulated conductors and cables that are suitable for installation in buildings of

non-combustible and combustible construction; and
c) FT6‡ — insulated conductors and cables that are suitable for installation in

i) buildings of non-combustible and combustible construction; and
ii) spaces between a ceiling and floor, or ceiling and roof, that may be used as a plenum in

buildings of combustible or non-combustible construction.
* Communication and optical fiber cables marked CMP, CMR, CMG, CM, CMX, CMH, OFNP, OFCP, OFNR, OFCR,
OFNG, OFCG, OFN, OFC, OFNH, OFCH, and communication and optical fiber cables marked FT4 have been found to
meet the standard criteria for FT1.
† Communication and optical fiber cables marked CMP, CMR, CMG, OFNP, OFCP, OFNR, OFCR, OFNG, and OFCG
have been found to meet the standard criteria for FT4.
‡ Communication and optical fiber cables marked CMP, OFNP, and OFCP have been found to meet the standard
criteria for FT6.

Armoured cables without exposed outer combustible jackets may be considered to comply with the
National Building Code of Canada requirements relating to flame spread.

Insulated conductors and cables with exposed outer combustible insulation or jackets that do not meet
the above classifications but that are installed in
a) totally enclosed non-combustible raceways;
b) masonry walls;
c) concrete slabs;
d) a service room separated from the remainder of the building by a fire separation having not less

than 1 h fire-resistance rating; or
e) totally enclosed non-metallic raceways conforming to Rule 2-132

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Sentence 2.4.1.1 (5) of the National Fire Code of Canada (2015 edition) requires that, when located in
plenum chambers, abandoned optical fiber cables and electrical cables with combustible insulation,
jackets, or sheaths be removed except when
a) the cables or raceways are permanently enclosed by the structure or finish, such as inside a wall

located in a plenum;
b) the cables or raceways are not capable of being removed without disturbing the building structure

or finish, such as when embedded in plaster, cement, or similar finish; or
c) there is a risk that the removal of the cables or raceways will affect the performance of cables in

use. For example, if abandoned cables are located in a cable tray together with cables in use and
their removal could adversely affect the safety or performance of the cables in use, then the
abandoned cables can be left in place.

Rules 2-132 and 12-1602
The flame spread requirement for totally enclosed non-metallic raceways can be found in
Article 3.1.5.23 of the National Building Code of Canada. The National Building Code of Canada permits
the use of totally enclosed non-metallic raceways for insulated conductors and cables in buildings
required to be of non-combustible construction, provided that the totally enclosed non-metallic
raceways do not exceed 175 mm in outside diameter, or equivalent cross-sectional area, and conform to
the vertical flame test requirement specified in Clause 6.16 of CSA C22.2 No. 211.0. The marking on
totally enclosed non-metallic raceways to indicate compliance with this flame test is “FT4”.

The National Building Code of Canada also permits the use of totally enclosed non-metallic raceways in
plenums of buildings. Where a totally enclosed non-metallic raceway is installed in a plenum of a
building permitted to be of combustible construction, such a raceway should meet, as a minimum, the
requirements of an FT4 rating. Where a totally enclosed non-metallic raceway is installed in a plenum of
a building required to be of non-combustible construction, such a raceway should meet the
requirements of an FT6 rating.

Δ Rule 2-134
The seismic restraint requirements for non-structural components and equipment in buildings are
located in the National Building Code of Canada in Article 4.1.8.18.

Δ Rule 2-136
It is the intent of this Rule to protect totally enclosed non-metallic raceways as well as insulated
conductors, and/or the jackets of insulated conductors, and cables against adverse effects caused by
direct exposure to rays of the sun. Electrical conductors and non-metallic raceways marked for this
application are suitable for installation and use for direct exposure to rays of the sun.

Insulated conductors and cables marked “SR”, “Sun Res”, “Sunlight Resistant”, “CMX-Outdoor” (for
communications cable), and outdoor cords and equipment wire listed in Table 11 for wet locations,
have been found to meet the standard criteria for sunlight resistance.

Rigid RTRC conduit marked “RTRC Type AG” and totally enclosed non-metallic raceways marked “SR”,
“Sun Res”, “Sunlight Resistant”, or “Outdoor” have been found to meet the standard criteria for sunlight
resistance.

CSA C22.2 No. 197 provides requirements for sunlight-resistant tape. The manufacturer’s installation
instructions provide details on the amount of tape overlap and correct application.

CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 198.1 provides requirements for sunlight-resistant tubing.
Rule 2-138
When insulation resistance or dielectric strength tests are performed, precautions should be taken to
ensure that voltage-sensitive devices such as ground fault circuit interrupters are not subjected to
voltages that will damage the device.

Δ Rule 2-318
The intent of this Rule is to ensure that at least one receptacle is available for portable chargers, tools,
lighting, and similar uses when the mobile industrial or commercial structure is supplied from the
alternate power supply.
Rule 2-324
Equipment considered to have relatively high losses generally consists of generators, motors,
transformers, and similar apparatus. Approximately 3.5 to 4.3 m3 of air per minute for each kilowatt of
loss is normally required for ventilating 40 °C rise equipment. A value of 2.8 m3 of air per minute will
have a temperature rise of approximately 18 °C when absorbing a 1 kW loss.

The temperature rise of all such equipment is based on a 40 °C ambient temperature.
Δ Rules 2-328 and 64-918 7)

The clearance distances specified in CSA B149.1 between a source of ignition and a combustible gas
relief discharge device or vent are as follows:
a) 1 m for natural gas; and
b) 3 m for propane gas.
Rule 2-400
Enclosures are not intended to protect against conditions such as condensation, icing, corrosion, or
contamination that may occur within the enclosure or enter via the conduit or unsealed openings.

Ingress protection (IP) describes the degree of protection an enclosure provides from ingress of water or
foreign bodies. [See the ingress protection table in the Note to Rule 18-102 5)]. For further information
on the IP designations, refer to CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60529. The IP designations are supplemental to the
enclosure types specified in Rule 2-400 and Table 65. There is no direct correlation between the IP

considerations such as resistance to corrosion or the effects of ultraviolet.

Section 4
Rule 4-000
Branch circuits include lighting, appliance, and power supply circuits, as well as flexible cords and
equipment wires, and are subject to the requirements of this Section.
Rule 4-004
The allowable ampacities of Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 are based on temperature alone and do not take
voltage drop into consideration (see Table D3).
Rule 4-004 1) d) and 2) d)
The ampacities shown in Tables D8A to D11B have been determined using the Neher-McGrath
methodology, as applied in IEEE 835, for the cable and insulated conductor arrangements shown in
Diagrams D8, D9, D10, and D11.

Tables D8A to D11B are based on 90 °C. If equipment rated at 75 °C, for example, is connected, then
Rule 4-006 may limit the conductor termination ampacity.

For “stacked” arrangements of two single conductors per phase in parallel (one row located vertically
over another row), it is recommended that ampacities be obtained from the Detail 5 column of
Table D8A (copper) or Table D8B (aluminum) for direct buried cables or from the Detail 2 column of
Table D9A (copper) or Table D9B (aluminum) for cables in underground raceways.*

For single-conductor metal-armoured and metal-sheathed cables in which the sheath, armour, or
bonding conductors are bonded at more than one point, the derating factors of Rule 4-008 apply, unless
the ampacity has been determined by detailed calculation according to the method outlined in
Rule 4-004 1) e), 1) f), 2) e), and 2) f).

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 547



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

It is recommended that ampacities for three single conductors per phase and for five single conductors
per phase with spacings, directly buried in the earth, be selected from Table D8A (copper) or Table D8B
(aluminum) for the installation configurations of Diagram D8, Detail 5 and Detail 7, respectively. It is
recommended that ampacities for three single-conductor cables per phase and for five single-conductor
cables per phase installed in separate underground conduits in a single bank be selected from Table
D9A (copper) or Table D9B (aluminum) for the installation configurations of Diagram D9, Detail 3 and
Detail 4, respectively.*

It is recommended that ampacities for three-conductor cables and for three single-conductor cables
grouped, directly buried in the earth, be selected from Table D10A (copper) or Table D10B (aluminum)
for installation configurations of Diagram D10, and ampacities for three-conductor cables in separate
underground raceways be selected from Table D11A (copper) or Table D11B (aluminum) for installation
configurations of Diagram D11.

It is recommended that ampacities for seven three-conductor cables in separate underground raceways
be selected from Table D11A (copper) or Table D11B (aluminum) for installation configurations of
Diagram D11, Detail 8.

It is recommended that the ampacities of groups of cables in twos, and two-conductor cables, be
obtained from the ampacity Tables D10A to D11B for groups of three single-conductor cables, and
three-conductor cables, for the appropriate spacings between groups and numbers of conductors in
parallel.* The neutral conductor of a three-phase, 4-wire system need not be counted in the
determination of ampacities.

Underground ampacities for conductor temperatures of 75 °C may be obtained by multiplying the
appropriate ampacity at a 90 °C conductor temperature from Tables D8A to D11B by the derating factor
0.886.*

Ampacities for underground installations at ambient earth temperatures other than the assumed value
of 20 °C may be obtained by multiplying the appropriate underground ampacity obtained from
Tables D8A to D11B by the following factor:

where

Tae = the new ambient temperature.*
* Where precisely calculated values are not available.

It is the intent of this Rule that where ampacities of underground installations of cable and insulated
conductors in a raceway size 1/0 and larger are based on conditions of use other than those set out in
the foregoing notes or the defined assumptions preceding them, they should be justified by precise
calculation based on IEEE 835.

Where IEEE 835 is used to compute the ampacities of copper and aluminum conductors, the following
data may be required by the inspection department:
a) Cable and insulated conductors:

i) type of cable or insulated conductors and voltage rating;
ii) maximum conductor temperature rating;
iii) maximum continuous current rating; and
iv) short-circuit rating;

b) Equipment:

Rules 4-004 1) g) and 2) g)
Ampacities for cables in these voltage ranges can vary substantially due to a number of factors,
including configuration, construction, orientation, ambient temperature, resistivity of adjacent material,
proximity to other cables, and other such criteria. It is important to note that the ampacities listed in
Tables D17A to D17N are valid only for the configurations shown and the conditions specified in
Table D17. A change in any one or more installation conditions or cable construction will result in a
change in maximum conductor ampacity. The cable manufacturer should be consulted, where
conditions or configurations differ from those shown in the D17 series of tables, to provide maximum
conductor ampacity values based on Neher-McGrath methodology.

Cables described in these Rules are manufactured and certified to CSA C68.5 and CSA C68.10.
Rule 4-004 20)
Nickel and nickel-plated conductors are recognized in CSA C22.2 No. 124.
Rule 4-004 21)
A covered conductor is a conductor encased within material of composition or thickness that is not
recognized by this Code as electrical insulation. Because they are considered uninsulated conductors,
covered conductors should always be treated as bare conductors for working clearances.
Rule 4-006
In accordance with CSA product Standards (e.g., CSA C22.2 No. 4 or CSA C22.2 No. 5), when equipment
of 600 V or less is evaluated relative to the appropriate temperature characteristics of the terminations,
conductors sized similar to those in the 75 °C column of Table 2 or 4 are used.

It is intended by this Rule that the size of conductors terminating on equipment described in
Subrules 1), 2), 3), and 4) be not less than the conductor size selected for the maximum insulated
conductor ampacity in the corresponding temperature column of Table 1, 2, 3, or 4.

This Rule is not intended to address conductor allowable ampacity (see Rule 4-004).

Regardless of conductor allowable ampacities determined by other Rules in this Code (for underground
conductors, cables, flexible cords, portable power cables, DLO cables, and conductors with higher
temperature ratings, etc.), it is intended that the minimum conductor size be based on the
requirements of this Rule.
Rule 4-006 3)
High-voltage equipment may be tested and rated for termination temperature at 90 °C. For high-voltage
installations rated up to 5 kV, where conductors are selected in accordance with Tables 1 to 4, 12E, or
D8A to D11B, or for high-voltage installations rated 5 kV to 46 kV, where insulated conductors or cables
are selected in accordance with Tables D17A to D17N, the equipment manufacturer should be
consulted when insulated conductors or cables are intended for termination on each specific type of
high-voltage equipment.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rules 4-006 4) and 5)
The 1.2 m length is based on test requirements from equipment Standards.
Rule 4-008
Induced voltages and sheath currents in metal sheaths and interlocked armour of single-conductor
cables
When an alternating current flows in the conductor of a single-conductor metal-armoured cable,
continuous or interlocked, an alternating magnetic field is created around the entire cable, which
induces a voltage in the metal armour sheathing. The magnitude of the induced voltage is proportional
to the magnitude of the current in the conductor and its length.

Sheath current will flow along the sheath as a result of the induced voltage, provided that the sheath
circuit is completed, e.g., by grounding both ends of the sheath (or by contacts made along the sheath
to the sheaths of adjacent cables or to metal building members). If the sheath circuit is not completed,
no sheath current will flow. If the sheath circuit is completed, the magnitude of the sheath current is a
function of the induced voltage and sheath impedance. Sheath current increases in magnitude with
increased spacing between single-conductor cables and decreases with reduced spacing (within the
range of typical spacings).

Sheath currents can be large and result in considerable heating of the sheath. Coupled with the heat
resulting from the passage of current through the conductor, the conductor insulation will subjected to
temperatures that can cause failure or a serious reduction in the life expectancy of the cable.

The phenomenon of sheath currents is common in varying degrees to single-conductor cables enclosed
in ferrous metals, as in galvanized conduit, and in non-ferrous metals, such as copper, aluminum, and
lead employed as cable sheaths, and will occur whether the enclosure is of the continuous tube or the
spiral armoured type.

Single conductors in free air — mitigating the effects of sheath voltages and currents
For cables carrying currents up to and including 425 A, sheath losses can be reduced to tolerable levels,
without the need to apply derating, by spacing cables approximately a diameter apart. This reduces the
induced sheath voltage (by virtue of the three-phase field cancellation effect at close spacing). For
cables carrying currents greater than 425 A, it is generally necessary to apply derating to avoid
overheating of the cable unless sheath currents are eliminated. To eliminate the flow of sheath
currents, it is necessary to ensure that all paths through which they may circulate are open-circuit.
Cable sheaths should be grounded at the supply end only and thereafter be isolated from ground and
each other. Sheath isolation may be attained by installing the cables in individual ducts of insulating
material, by employing cables jacketed with PVC or other insulating material, or by mounting
unjacketed cables on insulated supports. The sheath or sheaths should be isolated from any metal
enclosures or other terminations at the load end that might bridge them or cause them to contact
ground. The cable sheaths in such circumstances cannot be used for bonding the electrical system, and
a bonding conductor of adequate size for this purpose must be provided [see Rules 10-610 5) and
10-616].

Sheath currents are allowed to flow in single-conductor mineral-insulated cables, with phase conductors
grouped to minimize the flow of sheath currents [see Rule 4-004 10)] without Table 5B derating. The
sheaths are bonded to ground at both ends to provide an effective equipment bonding conductor.

Single conductors — external effects
The magnetic field around a single-conductor cable or single insulated conductors can create heating in
ferrous materials through which it passes, e.g., the wall of an enclosure, steel supports, connectors,
glands, locknuts, or clamps that encircle a cable or insulated conductor.

There are two effects. The magnetic field causes currents to flow in the wall of the enclosure (as an
example) through which a single-conductor cable or single insulated conductor passes. These are known

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 551



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

as “eddy currents” and create heating. The other effect is that the wall itself has magnetic properties,
and a magnetic field will be set up within the wall. The energy expended in setting this up causes
heating in the wall known as hysteresis heating. This type of heating occurs only in ferrous materials,
and only when the encircling ferrous material is in close proximity around the cable or insulated
conductor.

Single insulated conductors or single-conductor cables in free air — mitigation of external effects
Cables or single insulated conductors carrying currents 200 A and less, with typical spacings in air, do
not constitute a problem because of the low current levels. If the opening in an enclosure is large —
e.g., coming up underneath equipment through a large opening from the floor beneath — the
cancellation effect can be taken advantage of by grouping the phase conductors close together to
reduce the external magnetic field to the point where there is no impact on surrounding ferrous
materials that are not closely encircling the group. For all other cases, the preferred option is to cut out
a section of the enclosure a little larger than the opening required for the insulated conductors or
cables, and replace it with a non-ferrous plate through which the single insulated conductors or cables
pass.

Single conductors in underground locations
The wider spacings generally employed with underground single-conductor cables or single insulated
conductor installations, in comparison with cables in free air, can be expected to generate circulating
currents of greater magnitude in metallic sheaths or armours when these are bonded together or
grounded at both ends. It is necessary to correct all such installation ampacities to avoid overheating of
the cable if sheath currents are not to be eliminated. If derating is the desired course, the cable
manufacturer should be consulted because this factor depends on the type and size of cable and
installation arrangements and could be more favourable than the factor given in Subrule 1) a).
Rule 4-018 2)
Examples of non-linear loads include dimmers, computers, microprocessors, and most other electronic
loads.
Rule 4-022 2)
Examples of manual or automatic control devices are general-use switches, motion sensors, photocells,
light dimmers, or components of an energy or lighting management system.

Section 6
Rule 6-102
The supply authority should be consulted on the number and location of supply services.
Rule 6-112
Clearances for overhead conductors in this Code apply under the conditions existing at the time of
installation rather than at maximum sag and are therefore greater than, but consistent with, the
clearances specified in CSA C22.3 No. 1.
Rule 6-112 1)
It is not intended by this Subrule that an attachment point be provided for conductors other than
supply or consumer’s service conductors. Where an attachment point is provided for conductors other
than supply or consumer’s service conductors, the applicable provisions of Section 12, 54, or 60 should
be applied.
Rule 6-112 5)
Components that meet the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 82 include
a) tubular support members;

f) support member terminations (i.e., at the lower end).

As an example, a consumer service that does not exceed 200 A and 750 V, and whose supply service
span length is 30 m or less, is acceptable when the maximum unguyed projection of the support
member does not exceed 1.5 m, the cantilever load does not exceed 270 kg, three support clamps are
used, the upper one being located at the roofline and the other two being installed on the wall of the
building, a roof plate is provided to prevent entrance of moisture, the supply conductors or cables are
attached on the mast to comply with Rule 6-116, and a clearance of not less than 915 mm is provided
between the roof and the supply service attachment, except that the clearance may be reduced to
600 mm to the bottom of the drip loops. For a consumer service that exceeds 200 A or is over 750 V, or
whose supply service span length is over 30 m, or for non-standard mast installations (multiple masts
supporting each other), additional engineering provisions may be required, and consultation with the
inspection department and supply authority may be necessary.

Δ Rule 6-206 1) c) v)
Service boxes or other consumer’s service equipment should not be located below the flood elevation
as designated by the local floodplain management regulations or local bylaws. This requirement
provides for effective and safe disconnection of the service entrance equipment during a flood event
and is intended to prevent flood water from affecting access to the service disconnecting means.
Rule 6-206 2)
The local regulatory authority may forbid the locking of service boxes in the ON position, for example,
on construction sites.

Where the operating means of a service switch or circuit breaker is rendered inaccessible, it is
recommended that a notice be displayed on the outside of the service box enclosure, room, or building
advising of the location of the key to gain access to the service box operating means.
Rule 6-206 3)
Enclosures suitable for use in an outdoor location must be marked accordingly. Refer to Rules 2-400 and
2-402 and Table 65.

It is intended by this Subrule that enclosures not suitable for an outdoor location be provided with
equivalent protection from weather.

Δ Rule 6-212 2)
Code users should be aware that Clause 6.4 of CSA C22.2 No. 0.19 also allows service equipment to
contain associated equipment such as phase failure/phase reversal relays.
Rule 6-402 2)
The supply authority should be consulted regarding the acceptability of installing the metering
equipment on the supply side of the service box.

Section 8
Rule 8-002
Basic load
It is intended by this definition that only a typical lighting and receptacle load within an area bound by
the outside dimensions of that area signifies “basic load”. Such loads as outside lighting, specialty
lighting (i.e., stage, show window lighting, etc.), electric space heating, or air-conditioning loads are not
intended to be part of the basic load. Code users should be aware that the value of basic load for each
particular building occupancy is different and is dependent on the type of occupancy from Table 14 and
on load calculation requirements for residential occupancies.

Demonstrated load
The intent of this definition is to allow comparison of loads that are used in a similar fashion based on
the type of fuel source for heating and cooling, type of occupancy, type of occupancy load, and type of

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

operational requirements. It is intended by this definition that comparison may need to be made
between facilities in the same geographic area and also in similar climatic conditions.

With respect to determining demonstrated load and recognition of qualified persons, Code users should
be aware that it may be advisable to consult with the regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
Rule 8-102 2)
It is intended by this Subrule that, when overcurrent devices for feeders and branch circuits are selected
such that their rating is greater than the ampacity of the load due to the nature of the equipment they
feed (e.g., motors, transformers, and capacitors), the permitted voltage drop should be calculated on
the demand load of the feeder or branch circuit and not on the overcurrent device feeding the feeder
or branch circuit.
Rule 8-102 3)
Experience indicates that the voltage drop of lighting and general-use branch circuits in dwelling units
will meet the requirements of Rule 8-102 1) when the insulated conductor length from the supply side
of the consumer’s service to the furthest point of utilization is less than or equal to the values shown in
Table 68.

This Subrule is not intended to apply to branch circuits for the following:
a) household appliances (e.g., refrigerators, washing machines, central vacuum systems, and other

receptacles as per Rule 26-654);
b) kitchen receptacles [Rule 26-656 b)];
c) electrical heating and cooking appliances (Rule 26-744); and
d) other specific receptacles installed in dwellings, such as those dedicated for medical devices.

Rule 8-102 1) and Table D3 are applicable to these branch circuits excluded from Rule 8-102 3), based
on either the connected load, or one load equal to 80% of the rating on the overcurrent device,
connected at the furthest point.

It is intended by this Subrule that when the load on a circuit or feeder is unknown, the load value used
in determining the voltage drop calculation should be based on the maximum loading permissible in
accordance with Rule 8-104.

Further analysis has shown that these values will not affect the operation of the branch circuit
overcurrent protection.

Δ Rules 8-104, 8-304, and 62-114
When an overcurrent device is located in an assembly such as a fused switch or a panelboard, the
assembly is required to be marked for continuous operation of its overcurrent devices in accordance
with the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 4 or CSA C22.2 No. 29.

Fused switches and circuit breakers not marked as suitable for continuous operation at either 80% or
100% of the rating of their overcurrent devices are considered to be suitable for continuous operation
at 80%.
Rules 8-104 5) b) and 6) b)
It is intended that Subrule 5) b) or 6) b) be applied when the allowable ampacity of conductors is
obtained from tables such as Table 1, 3, 12E, D8A, D8B, D9A, D9B, D17A, D17B, D17C, D17D, D17I, D17J,
or D17M in accordance with Section 4.
Rule 8-106 9)
It is intended by this Subrule that demonstrated load data could be used for the purpose of sizing of
services or feeders. It is also intended by this Subrule that the qualified person, as determined by the
regulatory authority having jurisdiction, who is responsible for the design should be able, upon request,
to demonstrate to the regulatory authority having jurisdiction that historical data related to actual

demand substantiates the fact that this historical demand is the maximum possible demand for the
specific application.
Rule 8-106 11)
It is intended by this Subrule that the loads of the electric vehicle supply equipment controlled by an
electric vehicle energy management system should be considered to have a demand within the
maximum limits allowed by the electric vehicle energy management system.

The electric vehicle energy management system is provided with a maximum load rating, which
determines the branch circuit, feeder, and service loading.

Δ Rule 8-108
The intent of this Rule is to ensure that at the time of original installation, panelboards in dwelling units
are provided with additional space to add overcurrent devices for future growth. Where a panelboard is
suitable for installation of both full-size and half-size overcurrent devices, the provision for additional
overcurrent devices should be based on the total number of positions available in the panelboard as
identified on the nameplate or in the manufacturer’s instructions.
Rules 8-200 and 8-202
If more than one electric range is involved, the initial range will be provided for according to
Rule 8-200 1) a) iv) or 8-202 1) a) v), and any subsequent ranges will be provided for by
Rule 8-200 1) a) vii) or 8-202 1) a) vii).
Rule 8-202

For the purpose of this Rule, a motel unit with cooking facilities may be considered an apartment.
Rule 8-304
See the Note to Rules 8-104, 8-304, and 62-114.

Section 10
Rule 10-000
It should be noted that many installations employ grounding features that are not a requirement of this
Code but are designed to provide supplemental protection. As an example, the direct connection, often
used in industrial applications, between a vessel or some specific electrical equipment and a ground grid
is not a response to the requirements of the Code. The use of terms such as “bonding conductor” or
“grounding conductor” in relation to this supplemental protection is outside the scope of the definitions
for these terms given in this Code. Grounding and bonding as required by the Code are provided
through grounding arrangements at the source, service, or equivalent equipment, by the bonding
conductor run with the circuit conductor(s), and by the equipotential bonding of specified non-electrical
conductive objects.
Rule 10-000 b)
The use of the term “bonding”, as in the 10-600 series of Rules, describes a low impedance path
established to facilitate the operation of the protective device(s) of a circuit during a ground fault. The
term “bonding conductor” as defined in Section 0 is used throughout the Code generally to describe the
ground fault current carrying function of bonding.
Rule 10-000 c)
The use of the term “bonding” with the qualifier “equipotential”, as in the 10-700 series of Rules,
describes the interconnection of conductive parts or objects to create equipotentiality between them.
The term “equipotential bonding” is used in Section 10 to refer to the bonding of non-electrical
equipment to establish equipotentiality.
Rule 10-002 d)
The primary function of bonding as described in this Item is to provide a low impedance path to
facilitate the operation of protective devices under ground fault conditions. By interconnecting the non-

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

current-carrying conductive parts of electrical equipment, bonding also establishes equipotentiality
between that equipment.
Rule 10-002 e)
The primary function of equipotential bonding as described in this Item is to minimize shock hazard by
creating equipotentiality of conductive objects that may become energized either directly (e.g., a
damaged current-carrying conductor contacting a conductive object) or indirectly (e.g., parallel
conductive paths of ground faults or stray currents).
Rule 10-004
Grounded conductor
The term “grounded conductor” is used to refer to the conductor of an electrical system that is
grounded. The term can be used to refer to any of the following types of grounded conductors,
distinguished by the point at which the conductor is grounded:
a) a system grounded conductor (or grounded system conductor) is grounded at the source;
b) a service grounded conductor (or grounded service conductor) is grounded at the service box; and
c) a circuit grounded conductor (or grounded circuit conductor) is the conductor of a circuit that is an

extension of the system grounded conductor.

The conductor of an impedance grounded system that is grounded through an impedance may also be
referred to as the grounded conductor or as the impedance grounded conductor.

Impedance system bonding jumper
This term describes the connection between the grounded side of an impedance grounding device and
the non-current-carrying conductive parts of electrical system equipment.

Separately derived system
A separately derived system has no direct electrical connection to a supply authority system. Examples
of separately derived systems include generators, batteries, converters, inverters, isolation
transformers, and solar photovoltaic systems, provided that they have no direct electrical connection to
a supply authority system.

The earth, metal enclosures, metal raceways, and bonding conductors may provide incidental
connection between the supply authority system and the separately derived system. In addition, a
common grounding electrode can be installed for multiple separately derived systems as well as a
supply authority system. Two or more separately derived systems can be commonly connected either
by direct connection of phase conductors and/or grounded conductors and still be separately derived if
they do not connect to the corresponding conductors of a supply authority system. Where the
grounded conductors of two or more separately derived systems terminate at a common tie point, the
system bonding jumper and grounding conductor connections for all the systems are made at that
common tie point.

Where a system has a common connection with a supply authority system, through phase conductors
and/or grounded conductors, it is not a separately derived system. Examples of that are an emergency
standby generator connected to building loads via a transfer switch that does not switch the grounded
conductor or an interconnected power production source under the scope of Section 84. The grounding
requirements for such systems are met by the grounding connection of the supply authority system to
which they are conductively connected.

Solidly grounded system
A solidly grounded system is achieved when a current-carrying conductor of an electrical system is, in
addition to being connected to a grounding electrode, bonded to the non-current-carrying conductive
parts of the system via the system bonding jumper, thus establishing a complete low impedance circuit
for mitigating ground fault currents.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 556



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

System bonding jumper
This term describes the connection between the point of an electrical system to be solidly grounded and
the non-current-carrying conductive parts of the electrical equipment supplied by that system to
establish a complete circuit for ground fault currents. The system bonding jumper establishes a solidly
grounded system and extends the bonding conductor to the grounded point of the system.

Ungrounded system
No point of an ungrounded systems is grounded; instead, the non-current-carrying conductive parts
(equipment) of the ungrounded system are grounded.
Rule 10-100
The purpose of grounding is to establish equipotentiality between neighbouring exposed conductive
surfaces and nearby surfaces of the earth.

Under normal operation, there should be no objectionable current flow in the grounding conductor.
During a ground fault, the grounding conductor may carry a portion of the fault current as a parallel
fault current path, but it is not the primary intended path.

The use of multiple grounds on a system (e.g., grounding at the transformer and again in the service
equipment) may create a situation where there is an unbalanced neutral current on the grounding
conductor. An objectionable current on the grounding conductor can also be caused by an accidental
loosening or disconnection of the neutral conductor at a grounded main service on the line side of the
system grounding connection. Any neutral current on a grounding conductor is considered
objectionable. Corrective action for neutral currents on grounding conductors may require that
a) one or more of the grounds be abandoned;
b) the location of the grounds be changed;
c) the continuity of the conductor between the grounding connections be suitably interrupted; or
d) other effective action be taken to limit the current.

Currents in a grounding conductor that are not considered objectionable are those that may occur
under normal operation, such as the temporary current resulting from a ground fault or the induced
current from adjacent single conductors.
Rule 10-102
Manufactured grounding electrodes are manufactured to meet the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 41.

It is important that in-situ grounding electrodes provide a surface area contact with earth equivalent to
that provided by manufactured electrodes (see CSA C22.2 No. 41). Consideration should also be given to
the effects that corrosion may have on an in-situ ground electrode, affecting its durability and life
expectancy. For example, the metallic reinforcement of a concrete slab, concrete piling, or concrete
foundation and iron pilings in significant contact with earth at 600 mm or more below finished grade
have been found to be suitable in-situ grounding electrodes; however, metallic material encapsulated
with a non-conductive compound to protect it from corrosion does not meet the criteria for use as an
in-situ ground electrode.

In-situ grounding electrodes may extend from the earth for some distance (e.g., steel beams in direct
contact with the structural steel of a concrete foundation). To assure a permanent ground, it is intended
that the grounding conductor connection be made such that there are no insulating joints or sections
between the connection and the point at which the electrode contacts earth.
Rule 10-104
Grounding electrodes for signal circuits, radio, lightning protection, communication, and community
antenna distribution systems are examples of multiple grounding electrodes at a building.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 557



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 10-106
It is intended by this Rule that the use of railway tracks as an electrode be limited to the railway circuit
and lightning arresters for the railway circuit. The grounded conductor of a railway electrical circuit may
be used to ground metal conduit, the armour or sheath of armoured or metal-sheathed cable, metal
raceway, and the like associated with the circuit. A separate grounding electrode conforming to
Rule 10-102 is used for grounding interior wiring systems other than those supplied from the railway
circuit itself.
Rule 10-108
Recommended practices for the installation of a lightning protection system, including lightning rods,
interconnecting conductors, and ground electrodes, are given in CSA B72. Other national and
international industry-recognized Standards on lightning protection are also available. It should be
noted that the National Building Code of Canada mandates the use of CSA B72 as the Standard for
lightning protection systems.
Rule 10-112
It is recognized that copper, aluminum, and copper-clad aluminum are the most common materials used
for grounding conductors. Other materials may be used, such as copper-clad steel, steel-clad copper,
lead-clad copper, or steel-clad aluminum. Where these alternative materials are being considered, the
inspection department should be consulted to ensure that they are acceptable. Supporting information
for suitability of the material and proper sizing may be required. Consideration should also be given to
the compatibility of the termination methods at the electrodes, especially where they are not made of
the same material.

Subrule 2) requires that consideration be given to materials subject to corrosive environments. Copper
conductors in contact with aluminum are subject to galvanic action; aluminum conductors in contact
with masonry or earth are subject to corrosion. Therefore, as an example, the connection of an
aluminum grounding conductor to the electrode is made at some point above earth, normally at
450 mm or more. Precautions should be taken to ensure that deterioration from corrosion of the
material used will have no adverse effect.
Rule 10-114
Because the primary function of the grounding conductor is to establish a common reference to earth
and to create equipotentiality with earth, it is intended that the size of a grounding conductor for a
solidly grounded ac system connected to a grounding electrode need not be larger than No. 6 AWG
copper (4 AWG aluminum) nor larger than the system current-carrying conductor(s) of smaller systems.
Where alternative materials are being considered, the authority having jurisdiction may require
supporting information for proper sizing.

The grounded conductor of the system is the primary conductor between the service and the source for
mitigating faults. However, a parallel fault path back to the source is also present via the grounding
conductor connection at the service equipment, thus allowing the grounding conductor to carry a
portion of a fault current, depending on the impedance of the grounding circuit. Because the ampacity
of the grounded conductor is sized to effectively carry the fault current for the duration of a fault, the
size of the grounding conductor is inconsequential in terms of its role in mitigating faults.
Rule 10-116 3)
Protection from damage is afforded by either
a) mechanical protection, such as cable armour, conduit, tubing, or other substantive means; or
b) location, based on an assessment that the conductor is installed in such a manner that it will not

be subject to damage.

Further protection from damage is afforded by adequate securing and supporting means.
Rule 10-116 4)
When currents are imposed on the grounding conductor, the magnetic field encircling the conductor is
increased by magnetic material surrounding the conductor unless the magnetic material is bonded at

both ends. An increased magnetic field correspondingly increases the inductive voltage drop, thus
increasing conductor impedance.

Non-magnetic material such as PVC, aluminum, and some metal alloys are not affected by the magnetic
field and accordingly need not be bonded at both ends.

See Figure B10-1.

Rule 10-118
In making the connection accessible, care should be taken to avoid exposing the grounding conductor
and grounding electrode connection to damage, thereby jeopardizing assurance of a permanent ground.
Ensuring that the grounding conductor and ground clamp are not exposed to mechanical damage by
installing them below grade may be considered an acceptable method of “protection by location”.
Maintaining reasonable access where practicable can be achieved by locating the connection just
slightly below finished grade.

Where connection is made in a wet location or for direct earth burial, consideration should be given in
accordance with other requirements of the Code to corrosion or to the use of dissimilar metals.
Rule 10-202
The common conductor of a 3-wire dc system is the conductor common to two series-connected dc
sources (a bipolar system).

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 10-210
The system bonding jumper may be a bonding screw or bonding strap supplied with the consumer’s
service equipment, sized in accordance with the corresponding Canadian Electrical Code, Part II
Standard. Where the system bonding jumper provided by the manufacturer is removed or missing,
a field-installed system bonding jumper is sized in accordance with Rule 10-616.

Meter mounting devices are often supplied with a termination point for a system grounded conductor
(neutral) that is solidly connected to the conductive metal enclosure of the meter mounting device. This
arrangement may not have been tested for suitability as a system bonding jumper and should not be
used as such. If the grounding connections for a solidly grounded system are to be made at the meter
mounting device, an isolated neutral bus that incorporates provision for a bonding screw, a bonding
strap, or a field-installed system bonding jumper should be installed as prescribed by the manufacturer.

The term “grounded conductor” is used to refer to the conductor or point of an electrical system that is
grounded.

Where the midpoint conductor (neutral) of a single-phase or multi-phase midpoint system is solidly
grounded, the grounded conductor serves as the identified neutral conductor intended to carry the
unbalanced load (neutral currents). The grounded conductor serves as the bonding conductor in
addition to its primary function of carrying neutral currents.

A consumer’s service that is supplied by the supply authority and grounded at the meter mounting
device is shown in Figure B10-4.

Rule 10-212
See Rule 10-004 and the Note to Rule 10-004 in this Appendix for the definition of a separately derived
system.

In addition to the supply authority system supplying a facility, one or more separate systems may be
installed at the facility (e.g., a generator to supply emergency power, a transformer to supply a different
voltage to parts of the facility).

In a separately derived system that is required to be solidly grounded, the circuit conductors (the
grounded conductor and the ungrounded conductors) of the newly established system have no direct
connection to circuit conductors of the supply authority system other than those established by
grounding and bonding connections. The grounded conductor of a solidly grounded separately derived
system is grounded at only one point, with no connection between the grounded conductor and the
non-current-carrying conductive parts of electrical equipment on the supply side or on the load side of
the grounding point.

Figures B10-7 to B10-10 illustrate grounding connections permitted for a solidly grounded separately
derived system, as follows:
a) at the source of a separately derived system (see Figure B10-7);
b) at the first switch controlling the system (see Figure B10-8);
c) at each source of two separately derived systems supplying a transfer switch (see Figure B10-9);

and
d) at the tie point of two separately derived systems supplying a transfer switch (see Figure B10-10).

grounding two sources supplying circuits through a transfer switch:

Where two ground electrodes are used, one for each source of supply, it is good design practice to
isolate the grounded conductor for each system through an extra pole at the transfer switch. This
arrangement reduces the potential for nuisance tripping of ground fault sensing equipment (see
Figure B10-9).

Where a single grounding connection is made at the neutral tie point in a transfer switch, the grounded
conductor is not permitted to be switched if the system bonding jumper is installed at only one point,
either at the source or at the tie point. Figure B10-10 shows a circuit supplied from two separately
derived systems, with the grounding connection made at the tie point with no system bonding jumper

Where a circuit (including the bonding conductor) supplies the primary of a transformer, the system
bonding jumper of the secondary separately derived system forms a direct connection to ground via the
bonding conductor of the primary circuit. This system bonding jumper serves the two functions
described in its definition:
a) it carries any fault current likely to be imposed on it; and
b) it establishes equipotentiality.

It is the latter function, establishing equipotentiality, that ensures that the non-current-carrying
conductive parts of the electrical equipment are at the same potential as the grounded service or
primary source. Essentially, the non-current-carrying conductive parts of the separately derived system
are grounded via the primary bonding conductor. When it is required that the separately derived system
(secondary of a transformer) be grounded, the system bonding jumper, by connection to the non-
current-carrying conductive parts of the separately derived system, establishes a connection to a
conductive body that extends the ground connection.

This applies only to situations where both the primary and the secondary of the transformer are rated
750 V or less. At higher voltages, Section 36 requires a station ground electrode to be installed.
Figure B10-11 illustrates this alternative means of grounding a system operating at 750 V or less.

Rule 10-214 1)
CSA C22.2 No. 100 specifies the construction requirements for generators, including portable generator
assemblies.

A portable generator assembly
a) consists of a prime mover, a generator, overcurrent devices, and output receptacles that are

assembled and connected on a common machine frame; and
b) is capable of being carried or moved about by personnel.

A portable generator assembly is rated at not more than 12 kW and not more than 240 V and is
intended to be used as an isolated system for the supply of cord-connected electrical equipment.

As a condition of approval of certain types of electrical equipment, such as portable generators, the
manufacturer supplies instructions pertaining to its installation and operation. It is important that the
end-users closely follow the instructions supplied by the manufacturer to fulfill the terms of the
approval agreement.
Rule 10-214 2)
A mobile or vehicle-mounted generator that exceeds the rating of a portable generator given in
CSA C22.2 No. 100 is a power source that may be connected to a fixed electrical installation
a) to act as a stand-alone power system;
b) to act as a standby power source via a transfer means, in parallel with one or more other power

sources; or
c) to power only equipment mounted on the vehicle.

It may be configured as a solidly grounded system, impedance grounded system, or ungrounded system.
The applicable grounding requirements of Section 10 apply in each case.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

When only equipment mounted on the vehicle or vehicle-mounted receptacles for accommodating
attachment plugs are being powered, the generator frame or system neutral need not be connected to
a grounding electrode.
Rule 10-300
Impedance grounded systems have characteristics that can be of benefit to facility owners; however,
these systems rely on technology for safe and reliable operation. Special training is required to maintain
these systems and, when installed, it is important that they be kept up to date.

Δ Rule 10-302
An impedance grounding device (also known as a neutral grounding device) consists of neutral
grounding resistors, single-phase neutral grounding transformers, ground fault neutralizers (resonant or
Petersen coil), three-phase zig-zag transformers, or combinations of these, whose purpose is to
decrease the level of ground fault current for safety (reduced arc flash), to reduce loss of production,
and to mitigate equipment damage.

Other benefits of an impedance grounded system are to limit the voltage rise of the other phases so as
not to exceed the line-to-line voltage and to stabilize the system voltage-to-ground both during normal
operating conditions and during phase-to-ground fault conditions.

Conductors for high-voltage systems (greater than 750 V) are typically insulated for line-to-ground
voltages but are labelled as if they are to be applied on line-to-line, solidly grounded systems. A fault on
a single phase of an impedance grounded system causes the line-to-ground voltage on the non-faulted
phase(s) to rise as high as line-to-line voltage. If this voltage is likely to be applied for longer than 1 min,
the insulation of the cable should be upgraded so that it can withstand this increased voltage. Cable
suppliers should be consulted to confirm if the system being designed requires 100%, 133%, or 173%
insulation (or the equivalent, such as the application of 1000 V cable on 600 V impedance grounded
systems).

The ground grid system of the supply authority should always be interconnected with the consumer’s
ground grid system. Where impedance grounding systems are installed, a grounded service conductor is
not available for this purpose, and a separate conductor may have to be installed to interconnect the
two ground grid systems.

For systems experiencing a ground fault on one phase and permitted to remain energized in accordance
with Table 17, maintenance practices should encourage timely corrective action to avoid the
consequences resulting from a subsequent ground fault on a different phase.

Figure B10-12 illustrates an impedance grounded system.

Rule 10-306
Impedance grounding devices produce heat when faults occur. To avoid overheating, follow the
manufacturer’s instructions regarding clearances.

The warning signs required by this Rule warn against bypassing the impedance grounding device with a
direct connection from the system to the grounding electrode. It should also be noted that the source
of the system may be an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) or other source, in addition to the generator
and transformer.
Rule 10-308
The conductor connecting the impedance grounding device to the system source should be routed to
take the shortest and most direct route. The entire impedance grounded system depends on the
integrity of this conductor being free from faults or open circuits and, therefore, its routing should be
designed accordingly, minimizing its length, where possible, to preserve its integrity.
Rule 10-400
Ungrounded systems have traditionally been used for an added degree of service continuity and
reliability. However, a fault on one phase of a three-phase ungrounded system places a sustained
increased voltage on the insulation of the ungrounded phases, which tends to reduce the life of the
insulation. Although ungrounded systems are still permitted by the Code, they are increasingly being
replaced by impedance grounded systems, which provide better voltage-to-ground stability.

Ungrounded systems may provide greater continuity of operations in the event of a ground fault.
However, a second fault can be more catastrophic than a grounded system fault. Whenever ungrounded
systems are used, it is important that qualified persons monitor the system on a regular basis for early
identification of ground faults so that timely corrective action of the first ground fault can be made
before a second ground fault occurs.
Rule 10-402
In an ungrounded system derived from the supply authority, the grounding connection is between the
grounding electrode and the non-current-carrying conductive parts of the source equipment as well as

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

between the grounding electrode and the non-current-carrying conductive enclosure of the service box
or equivalent. For effective operation of ground fault detection when a ground fault occurs somewhere
between the supply authority derived system and the grounded service equipment, there should be a
conductive low impedance interconnection between the non-current-carrying parts of the source
equipment and the grounded service equipment.

There may not be a service box in an ungrounded separately derived system (see Rule 10-004 and the
Note to Rule 10-004 in this Appendix for the definition of a separately derived system). In such cases,
the grounding conductor terminates at the equivalent supply source equipment, such as at the main
switch or at the source equipment for the separately derived system.

Rule 10-500
Under normal operation, there should be no objectionable current flow in a bonding conductor.

Currents in the bonding conductor that are not considered objectionable are those that may occur
under normal operation, such as the temporary current resulting from a ground fault by way of
capacitive or inductive coupling.

In situations such as a ground fault, the bonding conductor is designed to carry the available fault
current for the time required to mitigate the fault. The equipotential bonding conductor may carry a
portion of the fault current as a parallel fault current path.

See also the Note to Rule 10-100.
Rule 10-502
Locknuts, washers, drilled and tapped screws or bolts, etc., that penetrate insulating coatings do not
require the coating to be removed first.
Rule 10-604
Supplementary bonding is required for service entrance equipment as the supply authority side
conductors are considered unprotected. Once past the main protective devices, standard bonding
methods apply.
Rule 10-606
Reducing washers are not tested for their suitability for maintaining a bonding connection. The use of
reducing washers to maintain bonding continuity is a misapplication of the product in non-conformance
with Rule 2-024.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 10-610 2)
It is not the intent of this Subrule to limit the use of cable constructions such as Type ACG90 that
provide a combination of armour in contact with an internal bare conductor as the overall bonding
conductor for the cable. These cable constructions rely on the use of suitable fittings designed
specifically for the cable (such as press fittings) as required by Rule 10-614 1).

Δ Rule 10-614 3)
CSA C22.2 No. 42 requires that receptacles be connected directly to a bonding conductor. For some
other devices, such as switches, the bonding connection is permitted to be made via the mounting
screws to the device enclosure. CSA C22.2 No. 18.2 requires that the mounting screw termination point
of a non-metallic device enclosure be electrically connected to a bonding means within that enclosure.
Installers should consult the manufacturer’s instructions for proper installation of wiring devices.
Rule 10-616
The principal purpose of a bonding conductor is to provide a low impedance path for fault current and
facilitate the operation of overcurrent protective devices, in addition to serving as an equipotential
bonding connection.
Rule 10-616 1) and 3) a)
When the system or circuit conductors on the secondary side of a transformer are protected only by the
overcurrent devices on the primary side, the voltage ratio of the transformer is applied to the
overcurrent device rating in applying Column 1 of Table 16.
Rule 10-616 3) b)
When the size of a circuit conductor is increased to compensate for voltage drop due to circuit length,
the ampacity of that conductor exceeds that required for the connected load and the rating of the
overcurrent protective device. The bonding conductor needs to be increased proportionately to
minimize the impedance of the bonding path and facilitate the operation of the overcurrent device. The
size of the bonding conductor is based on the circuit conductor allowable ampacity given in Column 2 of
Table 16 to compensate for conductor length.
Rule 10-616 4)
When system or circuit conductors are installed in parallel in separate raceways or cables, Rule 10-602
requires a bonding conductor to be installed with each set of parallel conductors.

When the size of each field-installed bonding conductor is based on Subrule 3) a), Column 1 of Table 16
is applied by dividing the rating of the overcurrent device protecting the conductors by the number of
conductors in parallel.

When Subrule 3) b) is used, the ampacity of each set of conductors in parallel in the group is applied
using Column 2 of Table 16.
Rule 10-616 6)
A metal raceway approved as a bonding means and sized to contain the circuit conductors adequately
serves as a bonding means for a given application.
Rule 10-616 7)
A bonding means that is integral to a cable assembly is sized based on the applicable product Standard
and is of adequate size for the purposes of this Subrule. See Rule 10-610 2) and 3).
Rule 10-700
This Rule applies to equipotential bonding of the conductive surfaces of non-electrical equipment,
devices, and structures where the control of voltage rise is required or desired.

The equipotential bonding of these conductive pipes and systems is provided to prevent them from
carrying a voltage different from the electrical system in order to control potential differences that may
cause unwanted circulating currents, galvanic corrosion, or tingle voltages. Continuous water and waste
water systems can, under certain circumstances, carry impressed currents from lightning strikes or

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 573



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

faults in neighbouring buildings where conductive piping may interconnect the electrical systems of
other structures that share the same water supply.

Waste water systems constructed of cast iron and rubber couplings are not considered continuous.
Metallic waste water systems that used solder joints are considered continuous. The installer should
verify that the system is metallic and continuous.

It should be noted that exterior gas piping systems may be required to be isolated from interior gas
piping to prevent the introduction of current as well as to preserve any cathodic protection of the gas
piping system. In general, this is accomplished using dielectric fittings at the demarcation between the
interior and exterior gas piping system. Any conditions limiting the equipotential bonding of the exterior
gas system should be verified with the local gas inspection authority.

It should also be noted that the requirement in Rule 10-700 c) to provide equipotential bonding to a
metal gas piping system is not intended to apply to metal gas tubing. Attempts to bond metal gas tubing
with conventional bonding means can create a hazardous situation where the tubing can be punctured
by installation of the bonding means or by arcing between improperly secured bonding means during
faults or lightning strikes.

Livestock are particularly sensitive to the effects of step and touch voltages. For this reason,
equipotential bonding is prescribed for all conductive metal parts (e.g., metal water pipes, stanchions,
water bowls or troughs, vacuum lines, and other metal objects that could become energized) accessible
by livestock in a building housing livestock.

Methods to establish equipotentiality at buildings housing livestock are described in ASABE
EP473.2-2001.

Low grounding electrode system resistances may reduce potential differences in livestock facilities.

Conductive materials used for equipotential bonding need not be wires and can take the form of
structural steel, bus, metallic framing and support structures, conductive static mats, or the support
structure of a computer room floor. Each of these materials, when adequately interconnected, form an
effective equipotential plane.

The user should be aware of the effects of galvanic corrosion where dissimilar metals are joined
together and ensure that the materials used are compatible or appropriately protected from corrosion
at joints and connections.
Rule 10-706
Connections to non-electrical equipment may not have electrical connectors specifically constructed for
the connection of electrical conductors. Conditions of use, good mechanical and electrical connection,
and the atmospheric conditions or corrosive nature of the bonding location should be taken into
consideration in selecting connectors and alternative connection methods.

Section 12
Rule 12-000
Reference should be made to the National Building Code of Canada or to appropriate sections of the
provincial/territorial building codes regarding the installation and use of combustible electrical
equipment such as raceways, boxes, and cables.
Rule 12-012
Wooden planks, when buried in the ground, should be treated with a solution of pentachlorophenol or
other suitable material as recommended by a manufacturer of wood preservatives. The use of creosote
as a wood preservative in such installations is not recommended because it is known to damage rubber
and thermoplastic insulations and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead.

Δ Rule 12-022 3)
The intent of this Subrule is to warn persons that there may be energized electrical circuits within the
roof decking system and precautions should be taken before cutting or penetrating the roof assembly.
Rule 12-100
Table 19 indicates the maximum allowable conductor temperature for various types of building
insulated conductors and cables. Where the surface temperature and/or the temperature on the
insulation of conductors, cables, or raceway systems exceeds 90 °C, such assemblies are a potential fire
hazard if installed adjacent to combustible material and, in such cases, the assemblies should be
relocated or supported in a manner to remove this potential hazard.

The low temperature marking on insulated conductors and cables indicates compliance with a test at
that temperature, as specified in the product Standard, but does not guarantee safe installation at that
temperature.

Care should be taken when installing insulated conductors and cables at low temperatures. Measures to
consider include preconditioning at higher temperatures prior to installation, and avoidance of
mechanical shock from dropping the insulated conductors or cable, unreeling the insulated conductors

When a conductor, cable, flexible cord, equipment wire, or portable power cable is being selected, it is
important that it be designed for the specific application and conditions of intended use. Rule 2-024
requires conductors, cables, flexible cords, equipment wire, or portable power cables to be approved
and installed for use within the design parameters for which they were manufactured and certified.

Consult Table 11 or 19 as applicable and the cable manufacturer to ensure that the proper conductor,
cable, flexible cord, equipment wire, or portable power cable is selected for the specific application.
Limitations on the use of certain product types may be specified in other Rules of this Code.
Rule 12-102 1) and 2)
For insulated conductors or cables without a low temperature marking, the minimum recommended
handling and installation temperature is –10 °C. Where marked –25 °C or –40 °C, the minimum
recommended handling and installation temperature is equivalent to that low temperature marking;
however, appropriate precautions should be taken for all installations at temperatures below –10 °C.

Appropriate precautions include
a) warming the insulated conductor or cable prior to handling and installation, in accordance with the

manufacturer’s instructions;
b) minimizing flexing of the insulated conductor or cable;
c) when flexing the insulated conductor or cable, bending the insulated conductor or cable slowly;
d) working with an increased minimum bend radius;
e) working with a reduced pulling speed; and
f) applying other precautions recommended by the manufacturer.

When designing installations intended to operate continuously at a lower ambient temperature,
consideration should be given to installing an insulated conductor or cable suitable for handling at that
temperature.

In addition to the application of appropriate low temperature precautions, insulated conductors and
cables should not be installed when the ambient temperature is lower than
a) –40 °C when the conductor or cable is marked “–40C”;
b) –25 °C when the conductor or cable is marked “–25C”;
c) –10 °C when the conductor or cable is not marked with a lower temperature limit; or
d) that specified by the manufacturer when conditioned, handled, and installed according to the

manufacturer’s instructions.

Once a conductor or cable is installed in a fixed position, it may operate safely at lower ambient
temperatures. However, the manufacturer should be consulted for additional instructions for all
installations when the conductors or cables will be subjected, either during or after installation, to
temperatures below the limitations marked on them.

Δ Rule 12-102 3)
The “Maximum conductor temperature (unless otherwise marked)” row in Table 19 is the maximum
operating temperature of the insulated conductor or cable permitted by the manufacturer. The
operating temperature of an insulated conductor or cable can be affected by the current of the circuit,
the ambient temperature, the proximity of the conductor to other conductors, where the conductor is
installed, and how the conductor is installed.

Δ Rule 12-102 6)
This Subrule includes requirements previously in Note 4 of Table 19 in the 24th edition (2018) of the CE
Code in correlation with the temperature limitations identified in CSA C22.2 No. 75.

equivalent wording.
Rules 12-510 4), 12-3000 8), and 12-3010 7)
Rules 12-510 4), 12-3000 8), and 12-3010 7) are intended to permit the use of a self-contained device in
lieu of a device box. A self-contained device is a wiring device with an integral enclosure having brackets
that securely fasten the device to walls or ceilings of conventional frame construction, for use with non-
metallic-sheathed cable. Self-contained devices used in dry locations are certified to CSA C22.2 No. 111
for switches and CSA C22.2 No. 42 for receptacles and are primarily used in mobile homes, recreational
vehicles, manufactured buildings, and on-site frame construction.

Guard strips are typically two pieces of wood installed, one on each side of the cable, to prevent
someone from standing on or kneeling on the cable as shown in Figure B12-3.

Cables secured to the lower faces of ceiling joists during rough-in are not required to have mechanical
protection in the form of guard strips if they will be concealed by a ceiling such as a suspended ceiling.
Rule 12-516
CSA C22.2 No. 18.3 provides requirements for inserts. CSA C22.2 No. 18.4 provides requirements for
protector plates and cylindrical bushings.
Rule 12-602
The steel wire armour (SWA) used in cables features inherently different mechanical characteristics
from conventional interlocked armour. Due to its physical structure, steel wire armour provides high
tensile strength but may provide less mechanical protection than interlocked armour when, for
example, subjected to puncture. The user should consider the particular application when selecting
SWA for cables.
Rule 12-610 1)
The paper or plastic wrap around the cable core, directly under the armour of an armoured cable, is not
considered the inner jacket referred to in Item b).

Δ Rule 12-610 5)
CSA C22.2 No. 18.3 allows markings for connectors intended for Type ACG90 and ACGWU90 cables to
be on the connectors or the smallest unit carton. Types ACG90 and ACGWU90 include a full-size bare
aluminum bonding conductor in direct intimate contact with the interlocked armour. Selection of

appropriate connectors for this application is necessary to ensure that bonding continuity is maintained
between the cable armour and the connector.
Rule 12-714
Mineral-insulated cable has a copper, aluminum, or stainless steel sheath. Box connectors suitable for
use with the particular sheath material should therefore be used.

Δ Rule 12-718
See Rule 4-006 for maximum termination temperature.
Rule 12-802
The bottom shield may or may not be incorporated as an integral part of the whole system. The top
shield and the metal tape may be two separate components or may be a single integral component of
the Type FCC system.
Rule 12-814
Tapes having a conductive surface in intimate electrical contact with metal shields throughout the
Type FCC system are considered to be bonded when approved for the purpose.
Rule 12-902
Armoured cables intended to be pulled into conduit or tubing are subject to damage when the
maximum pulling tension is exceeded or the sidewall bearing pressure is beyond the capability of the
cable. Typically, the limiting factor in these installations is the sidewall bearing pressure. Cable
specification data and calculation methods to determine the acceptable length of cable to be pulled into
a raceway are available from cable manufacturers. Furthermore, the minimum cable bending radius
must be considered. There may be different values for the minimum bending radii depending on the
type of cable. The cable manufacturer should be consulted for accurate values of the minimum bending
radii of specific cables.

The examples of acceptable installations described in Item 2) b) ii) are based on a maximum cable size
of 1000 kcmil and a run of raceway with a 90° bend at each end, using bends with a 0.944 m radius for
low-voltage cable and bends with a 1.524 m radius for high-voltage cable. Installations beyond these
parameters should have calculations completed to establish acceptability.
Rule 12-904
See the Note to Rules 12-106, 12-904, and 12-3030.

Δ Rule 12-910
The maximum permitted number of insulated conductors and cables in a raceway is based on the actual
measured dimensions of the raceways and the insulated conductors and cables. Where calculations of
the maximum number of permitted insulated conductors and cables in a given raceway are based on
supplied dimensions or product Standards, they should be validated by measuring the products
concerned before installation.

The Standards for the raceways detailed in Tables 9A to 9H are as follows:
• CSA C22.2 No. 45.1 — Rigid metal conduit
• CSA C22.2 No. 56 — Flexible metal conduit
• CSA C22.2 No. 211.2 — Rigid PVC conduit

Calculating the maximum permissible number of conductors of the same size in a given raceway
provides an alternative basis for determining the maximum number of permitted conductors, provided
that the dimensions of such raceways and conductors are derived from Tables 9A to 9H, 10A, and 10B.
The maximum numbers of single conductors of one size permitted in a conduit or raceway as
determined from Tables 6A to 6K are based on these tables, with no allowance for bare bonding or
grounding conductors.

Subrule 6) does not permit Tables 6A to 6K to be used to determine the number of insulated conductors
of the same size in one HDPE conduit because for each available trade size, HDPE conduit has the
smallest internal diameter.

Dimensions of bare bonding or grounding conductors, such as bonding conductors that are required for
some raceway installations under applicable Code Rules, may be obtained from Table D5. They should
be verified by measurement before installation.
Rule 12-936
Where raceways pass across structural expansion or control joints, possible relative movement that
could damage the raceway should be accommodated in the design.
Rules 12-944 and 12-3000 4)
The intent of this Rule is to protect metal raceways and boxes against corrosion in concrete slabs of
unheated parkades and similar structures, where permeation of salt represents a corrosion hazard.
Users of this Code should be aware that CSA S413 restricts the use of metal raceways and boxes
embedded in concrete slabs where they are subject to corrosion.

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Example:

The change in length, in millimetres, of a run of rigid PVC conduit, due to the maximum expected
variation in temperature, is found by multiplying the length of the run, in metres, by the maximum
expected temperature change, in degrees Celsius, and by the coefficient of linear expansion.

For a 20 m run of rigid PVC conduit when the minimum expected temperature is –40 °C and the
maximum expected temperature is 30 °C, the change in length is

20 × (40 + 30) × 0.0520 = 73 mm
Rules 12-1104, 12-1154, and 12-1508
Tests show that 90 °C insulated conductors, continuously loaded, under conditions of 50% fill and 30 °C
ambient, do not result in a temperature exceeding 75 °C. Insulated conductors having insulation ratings
in excess of 90 °C may be used in PVC conduit, provided that the ampacity is derated to 90 °C.
Rule 12-1108
When bending PVC conduit, an open flame should not be used.
Rule 12-1118
Refer to the Note to Rules 12-1012, 12-1118, and 12-1214. In the example given, the change in length is
73 mm and therefore one or more expansion joints would be required, depending on the maximum
range that a particular joint is capable of handling.
Rule 12-1150
Precautions should be taken to ensure that no pour of concrete and/or its reinforcement exerts a load
on the conduit that will render the conduit unsuitable for use. Too high a pour may cause failure
through collapse on overloading when the concrete is in a wet (uncured) state.
Rule 12-1154
See the Note to Rules 12-1104, 12-1154, and 12-1508.
Rule 12-1156
In general, a thermostatically controlled heat gun may be used for field bends on trade sizes up to
53 trade size. For sizes 27 to 53 trade sizes, springs or equivalent devices should be used in conjunction
with the heat gun to prevent reduction of the internal diameter. For sizes larger than 53 trade size,
special jigs, moulds, springs, and heating arrangements are required.

See also the Note to Rule 12-1108.
Rule 12-1158
When connecting rigid Types EB1 and DB2/ES2 PVC conduit to conduit made of materials other than
PVC through the use of a taper threaded connection, it is preferable that a female threaded adapter be
made from the same PVC material as the PVC conduit and the male threaded adapter be made from
materials suited to the other than PVC material.
Rule 12-1204
Specific requirements pertaining to use of combustible conduit and tubing in buildings can be found in
Articles 3.1.4.3, 3.1.5.15, 3.1.5.17, and 3.1.5.20 of the National Building Code of Canada or in the
appropriate provincial/territorial legislation.
Rule 12-1214
See the Note to Rules 12-1012, 12-1118, and 12-1214.
Rule 12-1254 5) b)
Horizontal directional drilling and plow-trenching installations are greatly affected by soil conditions,
which vary for each installation. Soil containing sand, loose gravel, cobbles, boulders, or other
obstructions induce significant crush loads on conduits; therefore, thicker walled conduit is required.

Rule 12-1606
In applying this Rule, the “minimum available cross-sectional area” is the minimum cross-sectional area
of the surface raceway minus the maximum cross-sectional area of any device installed in the surface
raceway that projects into the surface raceway.
Rule 12-2200
Recommended installation requirements are available from the manufacturer of cable trays. Additional
points to consider include the following:
a) the ideal support point for cable trays is at the one-quarter span point. Locating cable tray supports

at or near the centre of a span or near cable tray joints may significantly increase the deflection of
cable trays;

b) there should not be more than one joint between support points;
c) allowance for wind and snow loading should be included within the maximum design load; and
d) some fittings (particularly horizontal elbows) may require additional support, depending on the

loading.
Rule 12-2202
Particular concerns to address when installing insulated conductors and cable in cable trays are
a) protection by elevation or other means at traffic areas;
b) protection from falling objects through the use of covers, shields, or other means;
c) protection from radiant heat by heat shields, insulation, or other means;
d) protection from people walking on insulated conductors or cables in trays by covers, guards,

location, or other means; and
e) protection from movable objects, stored goods, or other material by elevation, covers, guards, or

other means.
Rule 12-2202 3)
CSA C22.2 No. 126.1 and CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 126.2 require the marking on the cable tray to include the
load/span rating of the cable tray.
Rule 12-2250
Rules 12-2250 to 12-2258 are intended to provide the electrical and mechanical requirements for
installation of a metal-enclosed cablebus system.

A cablebus system includes all necessary straight sections, fittings, cable support blocks, covers, splice
plates, hardware, weatherproof entrance fittings, fire stops, single insulated conductors or cables,
compression lugs, termination kits, external supports, and other accessories required to form a
complete system.

It is also intended by these Rules that a complete set of engineering drawings and installation drawings
be made available for each system to facilitate system design, construction, and installation; to include
electrical detail of the insulated conductor or cable configuration, together with enclosure dimensions;
and to specify maximum allowable span support. It is also intended that each straight section and fitting
be individually identified with an affixed label to correspond to an itemized list as shown on the
installation drawing.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 585



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

The intent of these Rules is to establish that cablebus systems are assembled at the point of installation
in accordance with installation drawings provided by the manufacturer. It is also intended that cablebus
representing a complete system approved for the purpose be marked as such in accordance with the
product Standard.
Rule 12-2252
CSA C22.2 No. 273 defines Class A and Class B cablebus as follows:

Class A cablebus — cablebus that provides protection from contact with [insulated] conductors
[or cables] by design and construction of the enclosure.

Class B cablebus — cablebus that does not provide protection from contact with [insulated] conductors
[or cables] by design and construction of the enclosure.

Cablebus not marked as Class A is considered to be Class B.
Rules 12-2252 and 12-2254
It is intended by these Rules that cablebus be manufactured to be suitable for indoor and outdoor use,
with load-bearing members of the cablebus system, including side rails, rungs, and splices for maximum
strength and equipment bonding conductor ratings. Straight sections of enclosure are capable of
supporting spans of up to 3.7 m, including an allowance for wind and snow loading, within the
maximum design load. Insulated conductors are positively secured on supports spaced a maximum of
900 mm horizontally and 450 mm vertically along the length of the cablebus. Upon completion of the
installation, the entire field assembly is approved as a complete system.
Rule 12-2258
CSA C22.2 No. 273 allows optional testing for cablebus intended to be used as a bonding conductor.
Cablebus meeting the bonding requirements includes the following or equivalent wording on the
cablebus nameplate:

CABLEBUS ENCLOSURE HAS BEEN TESTED AS A SYSTEM BOND CONDUCTOR.

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rules 12-3000 10) and 12-3002 2)
CSA C22.2 No. 18.1, CSA C22.2 No. 18.2, and CSA C22.2 No. 85 require that all floor boxes be provided
with installation instructions indicating the type of floor structure with which they are intended to be
installed. Floor box covers intended for use only in a floor covered with carpet or wood are marked on
the product or smallest unit shipping carton “Not for use with tile covered floors”, or the equivalent.
Rule 12-3016 3)
The intent of this Subrule is that the installation of an outlet box requiring a wet location cover plate
will be such that the box and cover are in intimate contact and will provide a seal to prevent ingress of
water into the outlet box.
Rule 12-3016 4)
The intent of this Subrule is that a flush box, cabinet, or fitting be of a type approved for the intended
location of installation (e.g., a flush box installed in a masonry wall should be approved for installation
in a masonry wall; or a fitting installed in a wet location should be approved for wet locations).
Rule 12-3030
See the Note to Rules 12-106, 12-904, and 12-3030.
Rule 12-3032 4)
It is essential that appropriate space be provided around circuit breakers and fusible disconnect
switches to allow proper dissipation of heat, in order that the specified current rating of insulated
conductors and protection rating of overcurrent devices be maintained. This Subrule specifies 75% as
the allowable portion of the wiring space, based on adding passive materials and 40% for current-
carrying insulated conductors. Code users should note that instrument transformers, energy usage
metering devices, and the associated wiring, although current-carrying, conduct only a small fraction of
the current borne by the load-bearing insulated conductors in a power distribution enclosure.

Δ Rule 12-3034 2)
When a reduction in the number of insulated conductors is required, this Subrule intends that the
reduction be made with the largest available insulated conductor size.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Section 14
Rule 14-000
Other Sections of this Code may provide additional protection requirements for specific circuits or for
specific equipment and the associated conductors.
Rule 14-012
It is the intent of this Rule to ensure that the overcurrent protective and control devices, the total
impedance, and other characteristics of the circuit to be protected are selected and coordinated so that
the circuit protective devices will clear a fault without extensively damaging the electrical components
of the circuit.

Interrupting ratings of overcurrent devices (circuit breakers or fuses) are 5000 A symmetrical maximum
for circuit breakers rated 100 A or less and 250 V or less, and 10 000 A symmetrical maximum for circuit
breakers rated above 100 A or above 250 V unless otherwise marked. The interrupting rating of fuses is
10 000 A symmetrical maximum unless otherwise marked.

Δ Rule 14-014
A series rated system is one in which either a circuit breaker or a fuse is in series with a downstream
circuit breaker that has an interrupting rating less than the fault current available at the line terminals
of the upstream overcurrent device. The upstream device always has an interrupting rating at least
equal to the available fault current.

This series combination is tested and approved at the higher rating in accordance with special
requirements for series rated devices in the CSA Standards for the equipment involved (e.g., circuit
breakers, panelboards, or metering equipment).

The tests verify that the combination acts together to safely clear a fault up to the maximum rating of
the line side overcurrent device.

The downstream equipment is marked, as a part of its electrical rating, with its series rating and with
the specific upstream overcurrent device required to achieve the series rating.

Where motors are connected in the system between the series connected devices, any significant motor
contribution to the fault current should be considered. It is generally agreed that the contribution of
asynchronous motors to the short-circuit current may be neglected if the sum of the rated currents of
motors connected directly to the point between the series connected devices is 1% or less of the
interrupting rating of the downstream circuit breaker.

Δ Rule 14-100 1)
This Subrule applies only to conductors and cables interconnecting electrical equipment. It does not
apply to overcurrent protection of electrical equipment as required by other Rules of the Code.

Δ Rule 14-100 2)
Consumer’s service conductors terminate at service equipment where an overcurrent device is located
(see Rule 14-104). This device provides overload protection, but not short-circuit protection, for the
conductors on the line side of the service equipment.
Rule 14-102 and Diagram 3
It is recognized that ground fault protection may be desired for circuits other than those described in
this Rule.

Ground fault protective equipment at the supply will make it necessary to review the overall system for
proper coordination with other overcurrent protection. Additional ground fault protective equipment
may be needed on feeders and branch circuits where maximum continuity of electrical supply to the
remainder of the system is required.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 588



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

It should be noted that with disconnecting devices located as shown in Diagram 3, no protection is given
for faults between the transformer and the disconnecting device. If this protection is required, the
primary disconnecting device must be tripped.

In any ground fault protective scheme, the protective equipment should be applied to ensure that the
external tripping power (if required) will be available whenever the circuit being protected is energized.

It should be noted that ground fault relays are usually factory set at the lowest current and shortest
time settings available to ensure against unnecessary equipment damage during early stages of
construction. These settings should be adjusted to the intended settings prior to final commissioning of
the equipment.

Multi-fed installations with ties and interconnected neutrals may be grounded at more than two
locations. In such cases, it will be the responsibility of the system designer to ensure that tripping occurs
only on the main breaker associated with the supply affected by the ground fault (see Items 3 and 4 of
Diagram 3). It is also recognized that for purposes of selectivity and continuity of service, many
installations, in addition to utilizing multi-feeds for systems, also use multi-stage ground fault protection
as described in Subrule 8). This results in complex schemes. In both of these special cases, the designer
should be required to submit data to the inspection department showing that such considerations have
been taken into account in the design of the system involved.
Rule 14-104
When conductors are selected based on a calculated load or a known load, Table 13 is useful in
selecting the appropriate rating of overcurrent device based on the installed ampacity of the conductor
for the installation. Code users are reminded that the circuit loading requirements of Rule 8-104 apply.
It is intended that the conductor ampacity values used in Table 13 can refer to single or multiple
conductors. Table 13 is also useful in determining standard overcurrent ratings for Rules such as
14-212 b) or 26-254 3).
Rule 14-108
Further information about assembly of circuit breaker overcurrent protection devices is provided in
CSA C22.2 No. 5.
Rule 14-114
Supplementary overcurrent protectors used as components of some appliances and equipment are not
suitable for the protection of branch circuit conductors.
Rule 14-204
There are two types of non-interchangeable plug fuses currently available, i.e., Types C and S as
described in CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 248.5.
Rule 14-212

CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 248.6 and CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 248.7.
‡ “Misc” (miscellaneous) fuse designations will remain in use for fuses that meet the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 106
and that do not have a “Class” designation.
Rule 14-302
The voltage ratings referred to in Item b) ii) covering single-pole circuit breakers suitable for use with
handle ties appear on each breaker, e.g., 120/240 V.
Rule 14-402
A relaxation to the requirement for a disconnecting means is allowed under Subrule c) because a plug
fuse can be safely handled while it is installed in a live circuit having only one ungrounded conductor.
Rule 14-508
The requirements for general use ac/dc switches are given in CSA C22.2 No. 111.
Rule 14-510
The intent of this requirement is to permit only manually operated switches that are designed,
constructed, and marked in accordance with CSA C22.2 No. 111 to be used.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 14-512
The requirements for manually operated general-use 347 V ac switches are given in CSA C22.2 No. 111.

Section 16
Rule 16-000 1) e)
Class 2 power and data communication circuits are based on the concept known as PoE (power over
ethernet) introduced by the IEEE 802.3 series of Standards. These IEEE Standards originally limited the
delivered power to 15.4 W. However, the limit was later increased to 25.5 W, and then two additional
power types were introduced: up to 55 W (Type 3) and up to 100 W (Type 4). Type 3 and Type 4 power
levels are incompatible with the Rules applicable to communication equipment given in Section 60 of
this Code but are compatible with the existing requirements for Class 2 circuits in Section 16.
Rule 16-200
A primary battery for Class 2 power sources consists of one or more cells electrically connected under
the same cover, with each cell producing an electrical current by an electrochemical reaction that is not
reversible, that is, non-rechargeable.

The use of the Class 2 circuits described in Subrule 1) a) to c) is highly dependent on the characteristics
of the device having a Class 2 output.
Rule 16-200 4)
It is intended by this Subrule that a device having a Class 2 output have energy-limiting characteristics
that limit the output current and power to acceptable values in accordance with CSA C22.2 No. 223. The
Standard allows a Class 2 power source to be inherently limited or not inherently limited. It should be
noted that maximum output current and power are limited as specified in the following Standards:
a) CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60950-1 for limited power supplies (LPS);
b) CSA C22.2 No. 223 for power supplies with extra-low-voltage Class 2 outputs;
c) CSA C22.2 No. 66.3 for Class 2 transformers;
d) CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 62368-1 for audio/video, information, and communication technology

equipment; and
e) CSA C22.2 No. 250.13 for light-emitting diode (LED) equipment.

Therefore, the Class 2 circuits described in Rule 16-200 are considered safe from a fire-initiation
standpoint and provide acceptable protection from electric shock. For wet locations, additional
measures, such as additional voltage-level restrictions to accessible live parts, or a physical safeguard
and marking may be required to provide protection from an electric shock hazard.

The Class 2 circuits described in Subrule 1) d) are also considered safe from a fire-initiation standpoint;
however, due to higher voltage levels, additional safeguards should be specified to provide protection
from an electric shock hazard that could be encountered.

Δ Rule 16-210
Both LVT and ELC are approved cables for Class 2 circuit applications under the conditions outlined in
Table 19. Type ELC cables do not have an overall protective jacket and are further limited in use under
this Rule to certain Class 2 circuits operating at 30 V or less, such as doorbells, intrusion devices, etc., in
dwelling units in buildings of combustible construction. Type ELC is not permitted for the wiring of
circuits related to fire safety, such as fire alarms or smoke alarm devices.
Rule 16-222 1) a)
With respect to the acceptance of equipment for connection to Class 2 circuits operating at not more
than 42.4 V peak or dc, consideration should be given to the fact that while Class 2 circuits limit the
power that can be dissipated in the circuit continuously, this power is more than sufficient to be a fire
hazard if dissipated in a fault within improperly designed equipment, e.g., shorted turns in a coil.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 16-222 2)
Examples of lighting products include the following:
a) luminaires;
b) signs;
c) rope lights;
d) decorative strings and outfits;
e) illuminated novelty items; and
f) lighting devices that incorporate light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Rule 16-222 3) a) i), ii), and iii)
The maximum voltage between any two output terminals under any load condition, including no load,
for Subrule 3), a) i), ii), and iii) is 42.4 V peak or (33 + 0.45 × the dc component voltage), up to a
maximum of 60 V. This corresponds to a limit of 30 V rms for sinusoidal ac waveforms, 42.4 V peak for
other waveforms, and 60 V continuous dc.
Rule 16-300
This Subsection applies to the installation of Class 2 power and data communication circuits consisting
of power sourcing equipment and powered devices operating as a complete system. Examples include
extra-low-voltage lighting systems, closed circuit television systems (CCTV), wireless access points
(WAP), distributed antenna systems (DAS), and building automation systems (BAS).
Rule 16-310
Power sourcing equipment
Power sourcing equipment is equipment meeting the requirements of CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60950-1 or
CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 62368-1.
Rules 16-310 and 16-340
For the application of the definition of a Class 2 power and data communication circuit, a circuit is
considered a twisted pair of insulated conductors or pair of twisted pair conductors within a common
cable assembly marked as being suitable for application from power sourcing equipment to a powered
device. This recognizes that more than one circuit in one cable assembly may supply one powered
device.
Rule 16-330 2)
Limited power cables complying with CSA C22.2 No. 214 are suitable for carrying both power and data.
Limited power cables are marked with the cable type designation, followed by “-LP” and “(x.x A)”,
where x.x is the current rating in amperes of each conductor in that cable.
Rule 16-330 4)
8P8C modular jack/plug (8 position, 8 contact) connectors are commonly used in this application and
are typically rated 1.3 A maximum per conductor.
Rule 16-330 9)
Although Table 60 references conductors that have the capacity to operate at 90 °C, in accordance with
IEC Standards, the connecting hardware typically used for these systems is not designed to carry any
current at that temperature. It is intended by this Subrule that when the termination temperature is not
marked on the equipment, the ampacity of the conductors be selected from the 60 °C column.

Section 18
Rule 18-000
Through the exercise of ingenuity in the layout of electrical installations for hazardous locations, it is
frequently possible to locate much of the equipment in a reduced level of classification or in a non-
hazardous location and thus to reduce the amount of special equipment required.

To assist users in the proper design and selection of equipment for electrical installations in hazardous
locations, numerous reference documents are available. Table B18-1 lists commonly referenced
documents.

* Area classification is a subset of design for hazardous locations.
† Product certification Standards are listed in Appendix A, not in this Table.
Rules 18-000, 18-006, and 18-008
The Zone and Division systems of area classification are deemed to provide equivalent levels of safety;
however, the Code has been written to give preference to the Zone system of area classification. It is
important to understand that while the Code gives preference to the Zone system of area classification,
it does not give preference to the IEC type of equipment. Equipment marked for use in Class I or Class I,
Division 1 will be acceptable in Zone 1 and Zone 2, and equipment marked Class I, Division 2 will be
acceptable only in Zone 2. See Rules 18-100 and 18-150 and Table 18.

The Scope of this Section recognizes that there are cases where renovations or additions will occur on
existing installations employing the Class/Division system of classification. It is expected that such
installations will comply with the requirements for Class I installations as found in Appendix J.
Rule 18-002

Combustible dust— combustible dust includes dust and grit as defined in ISO 4225. The term “solid
particles” is intended to address particles in the solid phase and not the gaseous or liquid phase but

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

does not preclude a hollow particle. See ASTM E1226 or ISO 6184-1 for procedures for determining the
explosibility of dusts. Dusts are considered combustible dusts unless it has been confirmed by test in
accordance with ASTM E1226 or ISO 6184-1 that they are not combustible dusts.

Combustible flyings — examples of combustible flyings include rayon, cotton (including cotton linters
and cotton waste), sisal, jute, hemp, cocoa fibre, oakum, and baled waste kapok.

Δ Explosion seal — a seal that is intended to prevent hot gases resulting from ignition of an explosive gas
atmosphere on one side of the seal from igniting an explosive gas atmosphere on the other side of the
seal (or, in the case of a cable seal, igniting an explosive gas atmosphere external to the cable). The
design of these seals also minimizes the passage through them of flammable fluids under atmospheric
pressure.

Δ Flammable fluid migration seal — a seal that is only intended to prevent the passage of flammable fluid
at atmospheric pressure. A flammable fluid migration seal is not intended to prevent the transmission
of an explosion or of flammable fluids under pressure. While explosion seals can meet this definition
(see the Note to Rule 18-072), other methods using compounds such as silicone or duct seal are also
suitable, provided that they are installed in a manner that will prevent migration of flammable fluids at
atmospheric pressure.

Hazardous location cables — cables that are certified to CSA C22.2 No. 174 are marked “HL”. Before a
cable type can be submitted for testing under CSA C22.2 No. 174, it must first be approved under a
CSA cable Standard, for example, CSA C22.2 No. 131. The additional tests in CSA C22.2 No. 174 ensure a
more rugged cable suitable for all hazardous locations. While “HL” marked cables are suitable for use in
all hazardous locations, they are not required for all hazardous locations. For example, tray cables and
instrument and control cables are also suitable for use in Zones 2 and 22.

Δ Primary process seal — a seal that is typically a part of electrical devices such as pressure-,
temperature-, or flow-measuring devices and equipment such as canned pumps which are in direct
contact with the flammable process fluid and prevents passage of that fluid into the electrical
connections or equipment.

Δ Secondary process seal — a seal that is designed to prevent flammable process fluids from entering the
electrical wiring system upon failure of a primary process seal. These devices typically prevent passage
of fluids at process pressure by a combination of sealing and pressure relief. It can be incorporated into
an electrical device or can be field installed on the wiring system that connects to the device.

Single or dual process seal equipment — an electrical device can be marked with either designation to
indicate that it incorporates into its construction and certification, primary or primary and secondary
process seals that will prevent the migration of flammable fluids into the wiring system, as specified in
UL 122701 or IEC TS 60079-40.

Δ Rules 18-004, 18-006, and 18-008
Reference material for area classification is listed in Table B18-1.

There is an equivalency in area classifications between the Zone system and the Class/Division system
as shown in Table B18-2. For equipment suitable for installation in hazardous locations, refer to
Tables 18 and 18A.

See also the Note to Rule 18-064.
Rule 18-004 2)
If a hazard assessment determines that an area is a hazardous location, an area classification is
performed. Due to the nature of hazardous locations and the risk of fire and explosions associated with
them, involvement by various individuals who understand the relevance and significance of the
properties of the hazardous locations identified in Subrule 1), are knowledgeable in the appropriate
classification Standards/guidelines, and who are familiar with the process and equipment, is essential to
ensure that appropriate measures are taken to mitigate the hazard. For a small or simple facility, this
may involve a single discipline, whereas for a large or complex facility, it may involve more than one
discipline, such as electrical, mechanical, process, safety, and operations specialists.

Documentation is an essential element in area classifications and may include items such as drawings,
studies and calculations, reports, and operating descriptions. This documentation should be maintained
and updated over the life of the facility. Appendix L contains more details on area classification
guidelines.
Rule 18-004 3)
Hazardous location classification documentation is authenticated by the person taking responsibility for
the classification. The person taking responsibility is normally an engineering professional or other
individual permitted to practise engineering.
Rule 18-006
Zone 0 area classifications
Typical situations leading to a Zone 0 area classification are
a) the interiors of storage tanks that are vented to atmosphere and that contain flammable liquids

stored above their flash point;
b) enclosed sumps containing flammable liquids stored above their flash point continuously or for

long periods; and
c) the area immediately around atmospheric vents that are venting from a Zone 0 hazardous area.

Zone 1 area classifications
Typical situations leading to a Zone 1 area classification are
a) inadequately ventilated buildings or enclosures;
b) adequately ventilated buildings or enclosures, such as remote unattended and unmonitored

facilities, that have insufficient means of limiting the duration of explosive gas atmospheres when
they do occur; and

c) enclosed sumps containing flammable liquids stored above their flash point during normal
operation.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 597



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Zone 2 area classifications
Typical situations leading to a Zone 2 area classification are
a) areas where flammable volatile liquids, flammable gases, or vapours are handled, processed, or

used, but in which liquids, gases, or vapours are normally confined within closed containers or
closed systems from which they can escape only as a result of accidental rupture or breakdown of
the containers or systems or the abnormal operation of the equipment by which the liquids or
gases are handled, processed, or used;

b) adequately ventilated buildings that have means of ensuring that the length of time during which
abnormal operation resulting in the occurrence of explosive gas atmospheres can exist will be
limited to a “short time”; and

c) most outdoor areas, except those around open vents, or open vessels or sumps containing
flammable liquids.

API RP 505 defines “adequate ventilation” as “ventilation (natural or artificial) that is sufficient to
prevent the accumulation of significant quantities of vapour-air or gas-air mixtures in concentrations
above 25% of their lower flammable limit, LFL”. Annex B of API RP 505 outlines a method for calculating
the ventilation requirements for enclosed areas based on fugitive emissions.

Industry documents such as API RP 505 provide guidance on how industry interprets a “short time”.

Flammable mists may form or be present at the same time as flammable gas or vapour. In such cases,
the strict application of the details in the classification Standards referenced might not be appropriate.
Flammable mists can also form when liquids not considered to be a hazard due to their high flash point
are released under pressure. In these cases, the classifications and details in the Standards referenced
do not apply. Information on flammable mists can be found in industry Standards such as
IEC 60079-10-1.
Rule 18-008
Readily ignitable fibres and flyings include rayon, cotton (including cotton linters and cotton waste), sisal
or henequen, istle, jute, hemp, tow, cocoa fibre, oakum, baled waste kapok, Spanish moss, excelsior,
and other materials of similar nature.
Rule 18-010
Maintaining electrical installation safety in hazardous locations is dependent on a regimen of regular
maintenance that will ensure that the electrical installation continues to provide safety throughout its
life. Maintenance personnel are cautioned that modifications to original equipment or substitution of
original components may void certification. In addition to the manufacturer’s instructions, the following
documents may be used to guide owners and operators of hazardous locations in developing
appropriate maintenance procedures:
a) IEC 60079-17, Explosive atmospheres — Part 17: Electrical installations inspection and

maintenance;
b) IEC 60300 series of Standards, Dependability management;
c) IEEE 902, IEEE Guide for Maintenance, Operation, and Safety of Industrial and Commercial Power

Systems; and
d) NFPA 70B, Recommended Practice for Electrical Equipment Maintenance.
Rule 18-050
At present, the marking requirements of Zone-based Standards and Division-based Standards differ
concerning the gas groups for which equipment is certified.

With Zone-based Standards, equipment marked IIB is also suitable for applications requiring Group IIA
equipment. Similarly, equipment that is marked IIC is also suitable for applications requiring Group IIB or
IIA equipment.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 598



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Equipment marked in accordance with Division-based Standards bears the mark of each Group for
which it is suitable, e.g., equipment that is suitable for Groups B, C, and D is marked to indicate such by
including all three Groups.

Rules 18-102 7), 18-152 8), 18-192 5), 18-202 6), and 18-252 5) indicate that equipment suitable for
Division-classified hazardous locations described in Annex J18 is also suitable for use in Zone-classified
hazardous locations.

Table 18 provides a summary of what equipment types are suitable for installation in the various
hazardous locations.
Rules 18-050 and 18-066
It should be noted that battery-operated and self-generating equipment is not excluded from the Rules
of Section 18, regardless of the voltage involved. Examples of such equipment are flashlights,
transceivers, paging receivers, tape recorders, combustible gas detectors, vibration monitors,
tachometers, battery- or voice-powered telephones, and portable test equipment that may be carried
into or located within a hazardous area. Such equipment may be eligible for approval under
CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 157 or CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-11.

Where general-purpose enclosures are used for such equipment and the Rules of this Section require
hazardous location equipment, the electrical equipment is required to be intrinsic safety or intrinsically
safe in accordance with Rule 18-066 and marked in accordance with the appropriate Canadian Electrical
Code, Part II Standards.

In cases where the Rules of this Section permit general-purpose enclosures with the qualification that
acceptable non-incendive circuits are incorporated, the electrical equipment should be approved as
such and marked in accordance with Rule 18-052.

The users of this Code should recognize that the Class/Zone system of classification uses a method to
identify gas groups that is different from that used by the Class/Division system.

Table B18-3 illustrates the correspondence between the two systems.

1) Most of the values in this Table have been obtained from IEC 60079-20-1, Explosive atmospheres —

Part 20-1: Material characteristics for gas and vapour classification — Test methods and data, Edition 1.0,
2010-01. In many cases, the name used in the IEC Standard differs from the name typically used in North
America for the same substance. In fact, chemicals may have several different names. The CAS numbering
system referenced in this Table is a well-known method of uniquely identifying chemicals and is a required
feature of MSDS documentation. Further information on the CAS numbering system may be found at

b) the symbol(s) to indicate the type(s) of protection used;
Note: For electrical resistance trace heating, the type of protection is designated as “60079-30-1”, which is
the product certification Standard number. The IEC allows an Ex marking to be the Standard number where
the existing types of protection do not fit the equipment. In addition, the ambient temperature markings in
CSA C22.2 No. 60079-0 do not apply to trace heating; however, the minimum installation temperature is
marked.

e) the equipment protection level (EPL) Ga, Gb, Gc, Da, Db, or Dc as appropriate; and
f) the certificate number as specified in CSA C22.2 No. 60079-0.

See the Note to Rules 18-090, 18-100, and 18-150 for additional information on markings.

The maximum surface temperature rating for equipment suitable for Zones 0, 1, or 2 is marked in
degrees Celsius or a temperature code, or both, to indicate the maximum surface temperature. See
Table B18-4.

Note: The bracketed temperature codes are for Canada only; they are not included in the IEC Standards.

The maximum surface temperature rating of equipment is based on a 40 °C ambient temperature,
except that if the equipment is rated for a higher ambient temperature, it is marked as such.

The maximum surface temperature rating for equipment suitable for Zones 20, 21, or 22 is marked in
degrees Celsius, preceded by a “T”.

Equipment suitable for Division classified hazardous locations has markings as stated in Appendix J,
Rule J18-052, and the associated Annex JB Notes.

Some equipment permitted for use in Zone 2 hazardous locations is not marked to indicate suitability
for Zone 2 because it is not specifically designed for use in hazardous locations [e.g., motors and

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

generators for Zone 2 that do not incorporate arcing, sparking, or heat-producing components. See
Rule 18-150 2) e)].

The Canadian Electrical Code, Part II product Standards for Ex equipment certification require that a
certificate number be marked on the equipment. The format of the certificate number is the name or
mark of the certificate issuer and the certificate reference in the following form: the last two figures of
the year of issue of the certificate, followed by “CA”, followed by the certificate number.

Where the certificate number includes an “X” suffix, it indicates that there are “Specific Conditions of
Use” detailed on the certificate that are to be taken into account during the selection and installation of
the equipment. For example, “CSA15CA1000X” identifies the 1000th certificate issued by CSA and the
year of issue as 2015 and indicates that there are specific conditions of use for the product. As an
alternative to the “X” marking, an advisory marking or a reference to a specific instruction document
containing the detailed information may appear on the equipment.

Where the certificate number includes a “U” suffix, it indicates that the product is an “Ex Component”
and is incomplete and not suitable for installation without further evaluation or certification. For
example, “QPS15CA0100U” identifies the 100th certificate issued by QPS and the year of issue as 2015
and indicates that that the product is incomplete and not suitable for installation without further
evaluation or certification.

Exposure of hazardous locations equipment to ambient temperatures that are outside the intended
ambient temperature range of the equipment can affect the explosion protection features of such
equipment. Some equipment may be marked with a safe ambient temperature range in accordance
with the relevant Canadian Electrical Code, Part II product Standards, but other equipment may not
have such markings.

Hazardous locations equipment subjected to ambient temperature conditions exceeding the design
maximum ambient temperature can result in the equipment operating at a temperature in excess of the
maximum (surface) temperature marked on the nameplate of the equipment, possibly exceeding
maximum internal operating temperature limits as well as the temperature limits stated in Rule 18-054.

Hazardous locations equipment subjected to ambient temperature conditions that are colder than the
design low ambient temperature can result in the equipment being subjected to excessive explosion
pressures due to higher gas densities at low temperatures. Cold temperatures also affect the brittleness
of materials, which can also compromise the explosion protection integrity of the equipment.

Note that ambient temperatures marked on equipment apply to explosion protection safety only.
Equipment performance is not considered.

Where an ambient temperature range is not indicated on equipment, the default temperatures are as
follows:
a) for products marked “Ex”, the design ambient temperature range is (–20 °C ≤ ambient ≤ 40 °C); and
b) for products marked Class I, II, or III, Division 1 or 2, the design ambient temperature range is

(–50 °C ≤ ambient ≤ 40 °C).
Rule 18-050 5)
One common example combines these Group markings with the equipment marked “IIB + H2”. This
equipment is suitable for applications requiring Group IIA equipment, Group IIB equipment, or
equipment for hydrogen atmospheres.

Electrical equipment marked Group II is to be installed as if it were Group IIC.
Rule 18-052
A typical example of equipment marking is as follows:

Rules 18-052, 18-090, 18-100, and 18-150
The 2011 edition of CSA C22.2 No. 60079-0 [adopted IEC 60079-0 (fifth edition, 2007-10)] introduces
“equipment protection levels” (EPLs) as a required marking on hazardous location electrical equipment
certified to the IEC 60079 series of Standards. This marking will appear on new electrical equipment
approved under the adopted 60079 series of Standards. For older equipment, in stock or in the field,
that does not include the EPL marking, suitability for the intended zone will continue to be determined
by the types of protection. EPLs will enable users to identify the zone(s) in which the IEC 60079 type of
hazardous location electrical equipment can be used, without having to identify the zone by the types
of protection used.

EPLs provide an indication of the suitability of electrical equipment for each zone. Further information
on EPLs can be found in CSA C22.2 No. 60079-0. See Table B18-5 for the acceptable EPLs for Zones 0, 1,
and 2.

Rules 18-054 and 18-150
Equipment of the heat-producing type is currently required by product Standards to have a temperature
code (T-Code) or maximum temperature marking if its temperature exceeds 100 °C. However, for
equipment manufactured prior to the T-Code requirement (prior to 1972) and electrical equipment
such as motors applied in accordance with Rule 18-150, there may be no such marking. Therefore, the
suitability of older hazardous locations equipment of the heat-producing type and motors applied in
accordance with Rule 18-150 should be reviewed in the context of Rule 18-054 before such equipment

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

is installed in a hazardous location. For the purpose of Rule 18-150, equipment such as boxes, terminals,
fittings, and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are not considered to be heat-producing devices.

Determination of the maximum surface temperatures for Rule 18-054 is set by the area classification for
the location in which the equipment is installed. This is normally based on the minimum ignition
temperature of the flammable or combustible substances that may be released into the atmosphere in
that location. The temperature markings on electrical equipment are in accordance with the
requirements in the Canadian Electrical Code, Part II product Standards, which set the specifications
determining where surface temperature measurements are to be taken. For equipment suitable for
Zones 0, 1, or 2, this applies to both external and, where gases can reach an internal surface, internal
temperatures. For example, type of protection nR applies only to external temperatures because the
design of this equipment prevents gases from reaching internal surfaces. For equipment suitable for
Zones 20, 21, or 22, this applies to external surfaces only. The design of equipment for explosive dust
atmospheres, with gasketing and other features to prevent ingress of dusts, is such that the only
concern for ignition is on the exterior of the equipment. Therefore, the maximum surface temperature
requirement for dusts applies to the external surfaces of the equipment only.
Rule 18-060
For the purposes of this Rule, metal-covered cable includes cable with a metal sheath or with a metal
armour of the interlocking type, the wire type, or the flat-tape type, or with metal shielding.
Rule 18-060 1)
Suitable lightning protective devices should include primary devices and also secondary devices if
overhead secondary lines exceed 90 m in length or if the secondary is ungrounded.

Interconnection of all grounds should include grounds for primary and secondary lightning protective
devices, secondary system grounds, if any, and grounds of conduit and equipment of the interior wiring
system.
Rule 18-060 2) b)
Where single-conductor metal-covered or armoured cables with jackets are used in hazardous
locations, the armour must be grounded in the hazardous location only to prevent circulating currents.
As a result, there will be a standing voltage on the metal covering in the non-hazardous location area.
There is, therefore, a need to properly isolate the armour in the non-hazardous area to ensure that
circulating currents will not occur.

Δ Rule 18-062
Optical fiber cables and equipment are being used more often due to advancements in technology in
hazardous locations, as can be seen by the recognition of optical radiation as a potential explosion
hazard and the adoption of CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-28 for optical equipment. It is important that
these cables are recognized for installation in hazardous locations and that they are installed to
minimize the risks of fire, explosions, and transmission of flammable fluids.

Some of these cables contain both wiring and fiber elements within them, and they are considered
electrical cables [see Rule 56-204 2)]. As such, they need to meet the “Wiring methods” Rules for the
applicable Zone.

When optical fiber cables are intermixed with electrical cables, they are also subject to the
requirements in Section 56.
Rule 18-064
To meet the intent of the Rule for effectively maintaining a protective gas pressure, the following
references for pressurization are recommended:
a) CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-2, Explosive atmospheres — Part 2: Equipment protection by pressurized

Rule 18-066
See the Note to Rules 18-050 and 18-066.

When reference is made to intrinsically safe systems, including equipment, wiring, and installation, the
term used is “intrinsically safe”. When reference is made to product certification and markings, the
terms used are
a) intrinsic safety “ia”, “ib”, or “ic” for Zone hazardous locations; or
b) intrinsically safe “Exi”, “Exia”, “Intrinsically Safe”, “IS”, or “I.S.” for Class I, II, or III hazardous

locations.

Non-hazardous location wiring methods can be used for intrinsically safe and non-incendive field wiring
circuits, with the additional restrictions stated in this Rule. This applies to the selection of wiring
materials such as cable, conduit, raceways, fittings, and junction boxes, as set out in the other Rules of
this Code.

Non-incendive field wiring circuits are energy-limited under normal operating conditions and are
intended for use in Class I, Division 2 hazardous locations. Non-incendive field wiring circuits provide the
same level of protection as “nL” or “ic” and are therefore suitable for installation in Zone 2 and Zone 22
hazardous locations. For additional information on non-incendive systems, see Annexes J18 and JB.
Rule 18-066 1) and 2)
The descriptive system document is necessary to ensure that all aspects of the intrinsically safe or
non-incendive field wiring installation are addressed and documented. See Appendix F for additional
information regarding descriptive system documents.
Rule 18-066 5)
Intrinsically safe and non-incendive field wiring systems are not required to prevent the transmission of
an explosion and therefore the only concern is the transmission of flammable fluids. Migration of
flammable fluids at atmospheric pressure can be prevented by the use of conduit and cable seals. Other
alternatives for cables include the use of a compound such as silicone rubber applied around the end of
the connector to prevent flammable fluids from entering the end of the cable. Where the flammable
fluids could be operating at pressures above atmospheric pressure, the provisions of Rule 18-072 should
be applied.
Rule 18-070
The definition of lower and upper explosive limits (LELs and UELs) in Rule 18-002 has been changed to
lower and upper flammable limits (LFLs and UFLs) and, therefore, has been revised in this Rule.
Flammable limits are material properties that are covered in documents such as IEC 60079-20-1.
Explosive limits depend on installation factors such as enclosure geometry or igniter location and
generally fall within a narrower range than flammable limits. Therefore, flammable limits are now used
because they are fixed values, define a wider range than explosive limits, are harmonized with IEC area
classification Standards.
Note: Combustible gas detectors read LFL even though the scale may be marked as LEL.

It is intended that this Rule be used only where suitable equipment meeting the requirements of
Rule 18-100 or 18-150 (whichever is applicable) is not available. In the context of this Rule, “available”
means that equipment certified for use in a specific application is available on the market. It is not
intended to refer to situations where certified equipment is available on the market, but the owner or
the installer does not happen to possess it. For example, Class I, Division 1 ignition systems for internal
combustion engines are not available on the market; only Class I, Division 2 ignition systems are
available. Therefore, ignition systems rated for Class I, Division 2 are currently the only hazardous
location ignition systems that are available and could possibly be used in Zone 1 locations.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

“Normal operation” in Item b) of this Rule means a piece of electrical equipment does not produce arcs,
sparks, or hot surfaces while being used in accordance with its design. For example, standard wall
outlets and standard plugs (i.e., outlets and plugs not certified for use in a hazardous location) are
designed to allow the plug to be inserted and withdrawn under load as a part of their normal operation.
Because this could create an incendive spark, standard wall outlets and plugs do not meet the intent of
Item b). Similarly, although a standard wall switch may be operated infrequently, operation of the
switch is part of its normal operation and will produce an incendive spark, thus making it unsuitable for
use under this Rule.

In many situations, proper area classification eliminates the need to use this Rule. This Rule should not
be used to compensate for improper area classification.

When this Rule is used, the gas detection system should consist of an adequate number of sensors to
ensure the sensing of flammable gases or vapours in all areas where they may accumulate.

Electrical equipment that is suitable for non-hazardous locations and that has unprotected arcing,
sparking, or heat-producing components must not be installed in a Zone 2 location. Arcing, sparking, or
heat-producing components may be protected by encapsulating, hermetically sealing, or sealing by
other means such as restricted breathing.

Before applying this Rule, the user should fully understand the risks associated with such an installation.
When this Rule is being applied, it remains the responsibility of the owner of the facility, or agents of
the owner, to ensure that the resulting installation is safe. Simply complying with the requirements of
this Rule may not ensure a safe installation in all situations.

Δ Rule 18-072
See Figures B18-2 and B18-3 for a flow chart detailing where explosion, flammable fluid migration, or
process seals should be selected for installations using cables and conduits.

UL 122701 and IEC TS 60079-40 provide construction, performance, and marking requirements for
process seals incorporated into process-connected electrical equipment. Equipment containing a
primary or a primary and secondary process seal that complies with these Standards is eligible to
include either the “Single Seal” or “Dual Seal” designation in the nameplate markings. These markings
indicate that the electrical equipment is designed to prevent the migration of flammable fluid through
the equipment into the wiring system when the equipment is operated at or lower than its rated
pressure. Devices certified as conforming to UL 122701 or IEC TS 60079-40 and marked either “Single
Seal” or “Dual Seal” meet the intent of Subrule 1) a). See Figure B18-1 for typical configurations of
process seals.

Where devices containing primary process seals are not marked to indicate conformance with
UL 122701 or IEC TS 60079-40, other means may be used to prevent fluid migration though the wiring
system. This may include the use of suitable barriers located between the primary process seal and the
wiring system, such as secondary process seals or short lengths of mineral-insulated (MI) cable.
IEEE 1673 provides construction, performance, and marking requirements for field-installed secondary
process seals. Where secondary process seals are installed, examples of design features that make the
occurrence of primary process seal failure obvious are vents, drains, visible rupture or leakage, audible
whistles, or electronic monitoring. The intent of making the primary process seal failure obvious is to
prevent continuous pressure on the secondary process seal and the possibility of an eventual secondary
process seal failure, as well as to protect personnel working on the device. Alternatively, where means
to relieve pressure on a secondary process seal is not provided, a cautionary label should be provided to
warn personnel that the enclosure may contain flammable fluid under pressure.

Process (flammable fluid) sealing is also required in subsurface applications, e.g., oil and gas wells.
Wiring and fiber optic systems have to be process sealed as they pass through the surface wellhead to
prevent flammable fluids from migrating through the wiring and fiber optic systems on the surface.
Implementing a field-installed secondary process seal on downhole equipment would be difficult

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

because of the need for a primary process seal with annunciation of failure. Sealing should incorporate
both primary and secondary process seals, which can be designated either “Single Seal” or “Dual Seal”,
as applicable.

Engineering considerations may lead to the conclusion that the probability of leakage from a specific
installation will be negligible. Acceptable factors such as an extensive history of safe operation with
similar installations, or the use of a primary process seal with a pressure rating well in excess of the
maximum process operating pressure, may be considered.

In conduit systems, the function of the primary and secondary process seals is to prevent flammable
fluids (liquid, gas, or vapour) that may be under pressure from getting into the wiring system. Beyond
the primary and secondary process seals, there is no opportunity for gas under significant pressure to
enter the wiring system. However, it is important to understand that in some situations [e.g., where
fluids under pressure are located in an enclosed space (such as in gas sample tubing inside a control
panel)], conduits and cables entering the enclosure may require sealing (a secondary process seal) in
case there is a leak under pressure from sources of release within the enclosure.

Downstream of the process seal, any fluids entering the wiring system will be at or near atmospheric
pressure. For example, if there is a major release of natural gas into a process building, it is not possible
for significant pressure to develop in the building because the walls and windows will burst at a
relatively low pressure.

There is no need to seal conduit against significant pressure in Zone 1. However, the conduit itself is
required to be in an explosion-proof enclosure; therefore, seals at the boundary of Zone 1 locations are
required to be explosion-proof to maintain the explosion-proof rating of the conduit.

In Zone 2, conduit is not required to be explosion-proof and, therefore, the boundary seals are not
required to be explosion-proof. They need only be flammable fluid migration seals, i.e., seals for fluids
that are not under pressure. A flammable fluid migration seal can be made using any suitable fitting
that has been filled with a material capable of sufficiently preventing the transmission of the flammable
fluid at or near atmospheric pressure. Properly installed explosion seals are one possible means of
providing a flammable fluid migration seal.

Cables with continuous sheaths will admit fluids only at the point where they terminate in hazardous
areas. Therefore, except in enclosures containing equipment with fluids under pressure, the probability
of flammable fluids entering cables after the process seals is low enough that only a flammable fluid
migration seal is required. In many situations, filling the end of the cable connector where the
conductors exit the connector (or where the conductors exit the cable when the jacket extends beyond
the connector) with silicone or other suitable material will provide an effective flammable fluid
migration seal in Zones 0, 1, and 2. Properly installed explosion-proof, flameproof “d”, or flameproof
“db” cable glands are also a possible means of providing a flammable fluid migration seal. As flammable
fluid migration seals are often not visible once they are installed, they are required to be identified. This
can be done with a label or tag located near the seals, identifying them as a “flammable fluid migration
seal” and indicating their location if it is not readily apparent.

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Δ Rules 18-090, 18-100, and 18-150
The equipment protection level (EPL) marked on equipment takes precedence over the type(s) of
explosion protection marked on it and may, to account for other aspects of the equipment, such as
material limitations, be more restrictive than what is normally applied for a specific type of protection.
To take the marking Ex ia IIC T4 Gb as an example: ia would normally be acceptable in Zone 0; however,
the equipment was constructed with a greater aluminum content than the product Standards permit
and, therefore, EPL Gb indicates that the equipment is restricted to a Zone 1 area.

For Zone 0, CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-26 provides for an alternative to meeting equipment protection
level (EPL) Ga where two types of protection suitable for Zone 1 (EPL Gb) would be permitted. In this
case, the equipment is marked with the two types of protection connected by a “+”, for example, Ex db
+eb IIB T4 Ga.

In some cases, equipment may be installed on the boundary of Zone 0 and Zone 1 and may have two
types of protection, with the appropriate type of protection for each side of the boundary identified and
connected by a “/”. For example, an intrinsic safety device installed on the wall of a flammable liquid
storage tank (Zone 0 inside) having a flameproof “d” or flameproof “db” termination compartment on
the tank exterior (Zone 1) would be marked Ex ia/db IIB T4 Ga/Gb. Equipment with a “/” marking is
accompanied by instructions for the user, specifying features and limitations of the separation element
between the Ga and Gb equipment sections.

CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-28 describes four possible methods of ignition of an explosive atmosphere
and focuses on two of them: absorption of optical radiation by particles or surfaces causing heating and
laser breakdown of gases, both of which can cause ignition. The Standard provides for three methods of
protection:
a) inherently safe optical radiation “op is”: visible or infrared radiation that is incapable of producing

sufficient energy to ignite an explosive atmosphere;
b) protected optical radiation “op pr”: visible or infrared radiation that is confined inside a medium,

such as optical fiber, where there is no escape from the confinement; and
c) optical system with interlock “op sh”: visible or infrared radiation confined inside a medium, such

as optical fiber, that has an interlock cut-off if the confinement fails.

Other, supporting equipment also requires certification in accordance with other Standards, resulting in
additional markings. The following are some marking examples:

Ex db [op is IIA T3 Ga] IIB T4 Gb — protected by a flameproof “db” enclosure and allowed into a Zone 1
area with gas group IIB and a T4 code; the optical system can transmit into a Zone 0 area with gas group
IIA and a T3 T-code.

[Ex op is IIB T4] — equipment cannot be in a hazardous location but can transmit into a hazardous
location with a IIB gas group and T4 T-code.

Ex mb op is IIC T4 Gb — equipment with an optical source, type of protection “op is”, protected by
encapsulation “m”.

T-coding and gas groups are normally independent of each other, but with optical radiation, this is not
the case because of the particular causes of ignition by lasers and the use of other, supporting
equipment. In addition, equipment may have more than one T-code or EPL for different parts of the
equipment. Therefore, attention must be paid to gas grouping, T-codes, and EPLs in applying optical
equipment.

See Table 18 for equipment and types of protection permitted in the three Zones. Other equipment
may be permitted by specific Rules (e.g., fuses in Rule 18-150).

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Δ Rule 18-092
Only intrinsically safe circuits are allowed in Zone 0; therefore, there is no risk of ignition. Then it is left
up to the designer to pick a wiring method that provides the level of mechanical protection that would
be required for secure operation of the process. For example, tray cable in tray would be acceptable for
intrinsically safe wiring. In many cases, such wiring is not needed as the Zone 0 equipment is installed at
the Zone 0 boundary, with the equipment connections not located in Zone 0.

For specific requirements and information regarding intrinsically safe wiring in Zone 0 locations, see
Rule 18-066 and the Note to Rules 18-050 and 18-066.

Subrules 2) and 3) deal with installations that require non-intrinsically safe wiring to pass through a
Zone 0 location. One common example is to supply power to a submersible pump motor in an enclosed
oily water sump. See Figure B18-4 for a typical example using cable.

Rules 18-100 and 18-150
The following briefly explains the various types of protection used in the Zone system. For further
information, see the applicable Canadian Electrical Code, Part II Standards.
a) Intrinsic safety (ib, ic): a type of protection based on the limitation of electrical energy to levels

where any open spark or thermal effect occurring in equipment or interconnecting wiring that may
occur in normal use, or under fault conditions likely to occur in practice, is incapable of causing an
ignition. The use of intrinsic safety equipment in a hazardous location also requires that associated
wiring and equipment, which is not necessarily located in a hazardous area, be assessed as part of
any intrinsically safe system. The primary difference between equipment marked Ex ib and Ex ic is
that equipment marked Ex ib must continue to provide explosion protection after a fault has been
applied.
Note: For Zone 0 areas, equipment marked Ex ia must continue to provide explosion protection after two such
faults have been applied (see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-11).

b) Flameproof (d): a type of protection of electrical apparatus in which the enclosure will withstand,
without suffering damage and without causing ignition, an internal explosion of a flammable
mixture that has penetrated into the interior through any joints or structural openings in the

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

enclosure of an external explosive atmosphere consisting of one or more of the gases or vapours
for which it is designed (see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-1).

c) Increased safety (e): a type of protection by which additional measures are applied to an electrical
apparatus to give increased security against the possibility of excessive temperatures and of the
occurrence of arcs and sparks during the service life of the apparatus. It applies only to an
electrical apparatus no parts of which produce arcs or sparks or exceed the limiting temperature in
normal service (see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-7).

d) Oil immersion (o): a type of protection in which electrical apparatus is made safe by oil immersion
in the sense that an explosive atmosphere above the oil or outside the enclosure will not be ignited
(see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-6).

e) Pressurized enclosure (p): a type of protection using the pressure of a protective gas to prevent
the ingress of an explosive atmosphere into a space that may contain a source of ignition and,
where necessary, using continuous dilution of an atmosphere within a space that contains a source
of emission of gas that may form an explosive atmosphere (see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-2).

f) Powder filling (q): a type of protection in which the enclosure of electrical apparatus is filled with a
mass of granular material such that, if an arc occurs, the arc will not be liable to ignite the outer
flammable atmosphere (see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-5).

g) Encapsulation (m): a type of protection in which parts that could ignite an explosive atmosphere
by either sparking or heating are enclosed in a compound in such a way that this explosive
atmosphere cannot be ignited (see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-18).

h) Non-sparking, restricted breathing, etc. (n): a type of protection applied to an electrical apparatus
such that, in normal operation, the apparatus is not capable of igniting a surrounding explosive
atmosphere, and a fault capable of causing ignition is not likely to occur (see CAN/CSA-C22.2
No. 60079-15).
Note: Type of protection “n” includes a number of means of providing protection. In addition to non-sparking,
component parts of apparatus that in normal operation arc, spark, or produce surface temperatures of 85 °C
or greater may be protected by one of the following:
a) enclosed break devices;
b) non-incendive components;
c) hermetically sealed devices;
d) sealed devices;
e) energy-limited apparatus and circuits; or
f) restricted breathing enclosures.
Some of these methods are similar to methods previously allowed in Class I, Division 2 locations.
To better understand the various methods allowed under type of protection “n”, refer to
CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-15.

i) Electrical resistance trace heating (60079-30-1): a type of protection applied to trace heating that
limits the surface temperature of the heater to below that which could cause ignition of an
explosive atmosphere (see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-30-1).

j) Optical (op is, op pr, op sh): see the Note to Rules 18-090, 18-100, and 18-150 for a description of
optical types of protection.

Δ Rules 18-102, 18-104, 18-152 1) b), 18-192 1) b), 18-202 1) b), and 18-252 1) b)
Cables meeting the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 174 are acceptable for use in hazardous locations
and are marked “HL”.

Cables marked for use in hazardous locations are suitable for all locations, but the termination fittings
must be suitable for the particular hazardous location. For example, in a Zone 1 or Zone 2 hazardous
location, a termination fitting entering an enclosure required to be explosion-proof, flameproof “d”, or
flameproof “db” must be a sealing-type termination fitting, whereas a termination fitting entering an
enclosure not required to be explosion-proof, flameproof “d”, or flameproof “db” in a Zone 2 hazardous

CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

location is not required to be marked for use in Zone 2 hazardous locations. It is intended that
termination fittings in all hazardous locations be compatible with the degree of protection and the
explosion protection provided by the enclosure they enter. In general, the minimum requirement will be
weatherproof termination fittings.

For the application of Section 18, rigid metal couplings are not considered fittings. The CSA Standard for
rigid metal conduit and couplings is CSA C22.2 No. 45.1. The Standard does not require hazardous
location markings. Certified rigid metal conduit and couplings are suitable for hazardous locations
without specific area classification marking.
Rules 18-102 3) a) and 18-152 3) a)
Where tapered threads are used, the requirement to have 4-1/2 fully engaged threads (i.e., threads
done up tight) is critical for the following reasons:
a) When the threads are not fully engaged, the flame path is compromised, making it possible for an

explosion occurring within the conduit system to be transmitted to the area outside the conduit.
b) If there are not 4-1/2 fully engaged threads, the flame path may be too short to cool the gases

resulting from an internal explosion to a temperature below that which could ignite gas in the
surrounding area.

c) Because the conduit forms a bonding path to ground, not making the conduit tight introduces
resistance into the flame path and, if a fault occurs, arcing at the interface may result.

While it may not always be possible to install certain fittings without backing off, it is important to
ensure that the connection is as tight as possible. Properly made conduit connections are critical to the
safety of hazardous location wiring systems.
Rules 18-102 3) b) and 18-152 3) b)
Tolerance 6g/6H is defined by ISO 965-1.
Rule 18-102 4)
It is recognized that electrical equipment that has been certified to IEC-based Canadian Standards
(IEC Standards adapted for use as Canadian Standards) may have conduit or cable entries with threads
that are either tapered or straight, complying with ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
Standards. Subrule 4) requires that appropriate adapters be used to ensure an effective connection to
this equipment where thread forms differ between the equipment and the wiring method.

ISO 965, Parts 1 and 3, may be used for guidance in understanding ISO threads.
Rule 18-102 5)
The type of protection “increased safety” incorporates protection from ingress of water or foreign
bodies. CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-7 requires that enclosures containing bare conductive parts provide
at least degree of protection IP54 (see Table B18-6) and that enclosures containing only insulated
conductive parts provide at least degree of protection IP44. It is important that conduit and cable
entries maintain at least the degree of protection provided by the enclosure by the use of devices such
as gaskets and sealing lock nuts. Increased safety enclosures should restrict easy entry of gases or
vapours in order to minimize the entry of gases or vapours from short-term releases.

Ingress protection (IP) describes the degree of protection an enclosure provides. The first number of the
IP designation describes the degree of protection against physical contact (i.e., fingers, tools, dust, etc.)
with internal parts; the second number designates the IP against liquids. For example, an IP54 rating
requires an enclosure to be dust-protected and protected against water splashing from any direction.
While the minimum requirement for an increased safety enclosure is IP44 or IP54 as stated in the
previous paragraph, typically most increased safety enclosures meet IP65 or IP66 rating.

For further information on the IEC IP designations, refer to CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60529.

Δ Rules 18-104 and 18-154
Seals are provided in conduit or cable systems to prevent the passage of gases, vapours, or flames from
one portion of the electrical installation to another through the system.

Some equipment may include markings such as “FACTORY SEALED” or “SEAL NOT REQUIRED” as
permitted by CSA C22.2 No. 30. These terms apply to conduit installations only.

The markings “FACTORY SEALED” and “SEAL NOT REQUIRED” are used interchangeably and indicate that
the termination enclosure for the equipment is isolated from ignition-capable components by an
internal factory seal, or that the equipment incorporates devices that have been assessed as not
producing arcs, sparks, or high temperatures.

For equipment marked “FACTORY SEALED” or “SEAL NOT REQUIRED”, the following applies:
a) In Zone 1 applications:

i) For conduit installations, an explosion seal is not required.
ii) For cable installations, an explosion seal is required.

b) In Zone 2 applications, because equipment that is not ignition capable [see Rule 18-150 2) a)] and
terminations housed in non-hazardous location enclosures [see Rule 18-150 2) c)] are permitted in
Zone 2 locations, an explosion seal for conduit or cable is not required in accordance with
Rules 18-154 1) and 4), respectively.

Passage of gases, vapours, or flames through mineral-insulated cable is inherently prevented by the
construction of the cable, but sealing compound is used in cable glands to exclude moisture and other
fluids from the cable insulation and is required to be of a type intended for the conditions of use.

Cables and flexible cords are not tested to determine their ability to resist internal explosions.
Therefore, regardless of size, each cable must be sealed at the point of entry into any enclosure that is
required to be explosion-proof.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 617



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Some designs of cable glands incorporate an integral seal, and these are marked “SL” to indicate that
the seal is provided by the cable gland. Cable glands of this type are identified with the class
designation. Designs requiring a field- or factory-installed sealing fitting have the group designation
marked on this component.

The appropriate sealing characteristics may be achieved by different means; therefore, the
manufacturer’s instructions should be followed.

Sealing of insulated and bare conductors in the conduit, or in most cables, requires that the sealing
compound completely surround each individual insulated and bare conductor to ensure that the seal
performs its intended function. In certain constructions of cables, specifically those containing bundles
of shielded pairs, triads, or quads, removal of the shielding or overall covering from the bundles negates
the purpose for which the shielding was provided. Testing of this type of cable now includes testing for
flame propagation along the length of the individual subassemblies of the cable.

The letters A, B, C, or D, or a combination of them, may be added to signify the group(s) for which the
cable has been tested, for example,
a) the marking “HL-CD” indicates that the cable has been tested for flame propagation for gas groups

C and D; and
b) the marking “TC-BCD” indicates that the cable has been tested for flame propagation for gas

groups B, C, and D.

See also Table B18-3.
Δ Rule 18-104 1)

It is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions closely; otherwise, seals will not function
properly to prevent the transmission of an explosion beyond the seal. Improper sealing has been the
primary factor in a number of explosions resulting in loss of life and/or major equipment damage. Users
are reminded that only the sealing compound specified in the instructions may be used in a seal. Use of
other manufacturers’ compounds in a seal may compromise the integrity of the installation.

Motors and generators for use in Zone 1 locations may be required to have a seal provided by the
manufacturer between the main motor or generator enclosure and the enclosure for the conduit entry
(connection box). Therefore, a marking regarding provision of the seal may or may not appear on this
particular class of product.

Cable glands with integral seals are marked “SL”.
Δ Rules 18-104 1) and 18-154 1)

Field machining of conduit openings is allowed in enclosures where indicated by the manufacturer’s
instructions, provided that they are carried out in accordance with those instructions. The restriction for
sealing field-machined entries within 50 mm is to address any variations in the quality of work. Other
entries may be acceptable but must be performed by a competent machining facility in accordance with
the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 30.

Δ Rule 18-104 6)
Reducers may have one side larger than the trade size of the conduit where the entry to the explosion-
proof, flameproof “d”, or flameproof “db” enclosure is larger than the trade size of the conduit.

Δ Rules 18-104 6) and 18-154 3)
Conduit fittings for use in Zone 1 or Zone 2 locations and similar to the “L”, “T”, or “Cross” type are not
usually classed as enclosures when not larger than the trade size of the conduit.

Δ Rule 18-106
Increased safety motors can only be safely installed and used in Zone 1 hazardous locations when
specific protection requirements for their thermal and fault protection are met. This ensures the
likelihood of a winding failure resulting in incendive arcing, or that an overload or a fault resulting in

high temperatures is unlikely to occur. These protection requirements are outlined in standard
IEC 60079-14.

IEC 60079-14 contains the requirements for designers and users to apply when Ex eb motors are used in
Zone 1. Requirements include the following:
a) protection from overload and short-circuits to prevent inadmissible heating;
b) application of cage induction motors;
c) operation, starting, and automatic reclosing (i.e., restarting after power failure);
d) use of winding temperature sensors;
e) operation of high-voltage machines;
f) operation of motors from a frequency converter; and
g) operation of motors using reduced-voltage (soft) starting.

For additional information on design and installation requirements of increased safety motors, consult
the following:
a) IEC 60079-14, Explosive atmospheres — Part 14: Electrical installations design, selection and

erection; and
b) CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-7, Explosive atmospheres — Part 7: Equipment protection by increased

safety “e”.
Rules 18-106 and 28-314
Users are cautioned that combining a variable frequency drive (VFD) with a motor may increase the
operating temperature of the motor as a result of the harmonics produced by the drive. This may cause
the motor temperature to exceed its temperature code rating. This is of particular concern where the
operating temperature of the motor is close to the ignition temperature of hazardous materials that
may be in the area. Because of the generally lower ignition temperatures associated with dust
materials, it will be of particular concern in explosive dust atmospheres. It remains the responsibility of
the user to ensure that the operating temperature of the motor, in combination with the drive, is below
the minimum ignition temperature of the hazardous material in the area. The motor manufacturer
should be consulted where necessary. The following are some references that may assist the user in
determining the suitability of an installation:
a) API RP 2216, Ignition Risk of Hydrocarbon Liquids and Vapors by Hot Surfaces in the Open Air; and
b) IEEE Paper No. PCIC-97-04, “Flammable Vapor Ignition Initiated by Hot Rotor Surfaces Within an

Induction Motor — Reality or Not?”.
Δ Rule 18-150 2) d)

Fuses functioning in response to short-circuit conditions is considered an abnormal operating condition
and has a very low frequency of occurrence compared to fuses which are installed in circuits where, in
addition to short-circuit conditions, they may function as a result of overload conditions. Fixed loads,
such as lighting loads, would be unlikely to produce an overload condition in normal operation, but a
motor subjected to variable mechanical loads offers the added possibility of overload. Where fuses are
used for motor protection, they would need to have the characteristics described in Rule 18-150 2) d),
or alternatively, comply with Rule 18-150 1).
Rule 18-150 2) e)
Rotating electrical machines of the open or non-explosion-proof type do not have a certification
Standard for Class I, Division 2; however, there are types of protection that can be used for certifying
these machines for use in Zone 2 locations. This Subrule provides the criteria for applying, in Zone 2,
rotating electrical machines that do not have a certification suitable for Zone 2 or Division 2. Refer to
IEEE 1349 for more detailed information on applying these rotating electrical machines in Zone 2
locations.

Liquid-tight flexible metal conduit and associated connectors intended for use in hazardous locations
are marked “HEAVY DUTY” or “HD”.
Rule 18-152 7)
Cable glands should be compatible with the degree of ingress protection and explosion protection
provided by the enclosure on which they are installed.

For example, to maintain the protection of an enclosure required to be explosion-proof, a sealing-type
gland marked for the location should be used. Where unarmoured cables must enter an enclosure
required to be explosion-proof, a combination of a sealing fitting marked for the location and a
non-sealing cable gland may be used.

Where equipment normally considered suitable for use in ordinary locations is acceptable in Zone 2
locations, such as terminal boxes and motors, ordinary location cable glands that maintain the degree of
protection of the enclosure may be used. Similarly, where purged enclosures are used in Zone 1 and
Zone 2 locations, ordinary location cable glands that maintain the degree of protection of the enclosure
may be used.

Where equipment is specifically designed for use in Zone 2 locations, such as “Ex nX”, ordinary location
cable glands that maintain the degree of protection of the enclosure may be used. One means of
achieving equivalent protection would be to use a cable gland with the same or better IP rating as the
enclosure (for ingress protection designations, see Table B18-6). If the gland does not have an IP rating,
other ratings, such as weatherproof, may be matched to the enclosure rating.

material limitations, be more restrictive than that normally applied for a specific type of protection. To
take the marking Ex ia Db as an example: ia would normally be acceptable in Zone 20; however, the

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Flash point is typically used to determine if the possibility of a liquid being released into the air requires
the area to be classified as a hazardous location. If a liquid is stored or used in an area at temperatures
below its flash point, the area may be classified as a non-hazardous area.

Section 22
Rule 22-002
Examples of some, but not all, of the occupancies in which Category 1 or Category 2 locations may be
encountered are listed in Table B22-1.

Table B22-1
Examples of Category 1 and Category 2 locations

Category 1
Basements (other than in residential occupancies) Dye works
Bathhouses Ice cream plants
Bottling works Ice plants
Breweries Laundries (commercial)
Canneries Stables for cattle only
Cold storage plants Stables for horses in rural farm areas
Dairies (commercial and farm)
Category 2
Abattoirs Metal refineries
Casing rooms Potato storage facilities
Chemical works (some) Pulp mills
Fertilizer rooms Railway roundhouses
Glue houses Stables for horses
Hide cellars Sugar mills
Meat-packing plants Tanneries

Rule 22-100
Circuit breakers located in a Category 2 location have experienced nuisance tripping due to internal
corrosion and may not operate as designed in all cases if located in a corrosive environment.

Δ Rule 22-108
When selecting wiring devices for a Category 2 location, the construction of the devices and the effect
of corrosive agents present in the area should be known and taken into account. General-use
receptacles, inlets, and switches, as well as connectors and attachment plugs, typically provide a
minimal degree of corrosion protection, which is likely to break down at an accelerated rate.

Manufacturers produce assemblies that are designed to mitigate the effects of corrosion and moisture
when located in Category 1 and Category 2 locations. Compared to general-use devices rated for
outdoor locations, these devices rated for Category 1 and Category 2 locations are typically marked with
Type 4X or 3X in accordance with Table 65, provide superior ingress protection, and are manufactured
from corrosion-resistant materials such as nickel.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 622



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Selection of enclosures and covers used for wiring devices may also be used to provide the needed
ingress protection or additional ingress protection for Category 1 locations. These enclosures and covers
may be Type 3 or Type 4, or may be tested as weather-resistant in accordance with the relevant
product Standards.
Rule 22-704
Sewage lift and treatment plants
Sewage lift and treatment plants produce a combination of conditions that may require specialized
attention to the electrical installation. Abnormal hazardous conditions can occur due to the buildup of
methane gas and spills of chemicals, gasoline, or other volatile liquids into the sewer system. Reference
material for hazardous area classification can be found in NFPA 820. Wet well areas normally contain an
atmosphere of high humidity and corrosive hydrogen sulphide vapours.

An extreme hazard to personnel working in wet wells is the presence of sewer gas (hydrogen sulphide).
This gas is treacherous because the ability to sense it by smell is quickly lost. If workers ignore the first
notice of the gas, their senses will give them no further warning. If the concentration is high enough,
loss of consciousness and death can result.

Before work in wet well locations begins, the air in the wet well area should be purged, and ventilation
with fresh air should be maintained while work continues in the area.

Δ Rule 22-800
A building housing livestock is typically a farm building (as defined by the National Building Code of
Canada) or part thereof, which provides shelter for livestock and is not a residential occupancy. In some
cases, a building that is not a farm building may house livestock.

The following definition is taken from the National Building Code of Canada:

Farm Building means a building or part thereof that does not contain a residential occupancy and
that is associated with and located on land devoted to the practice of farming, and used essentially
for the housing of equipment or livestock, or the production, storage or processing of agricultural
and horticultural produce or feeds.

Δ Rule 22-802
Livestock
The definition for “livestock” is not intended to include pets.

Specialty-type equipment
Examples of specialty-type equipment are robotic milkers, swine feeders, and heat lamps.

Suitably cut off
One or more of the following means could be employed to suitably cut off an area from a Category 2
location for the purpose of deeming such an area as a non-corrosive location:
a) use of a partition(s) incorporating a vapour barrier suitably protected from damage;
b) use of door openings incorporating a manufactured walk-in door with vapour seals and automatic

closers;
c) sealing conduit interiors against air migration at the first connection point from a Category 2

location;
d) adequately sealing all penetrations to prevent the passage of a corrosive gas to the non-corrosive

area; and
e) continuously maintaining the non-corrosive area with a positive air pressure supplied from an

outdoor source.
Δ Rule 22-804 2)

This Subrule is intended to apply to offices and equipment rooms where sealing and separation ensures
that the rooms are dry.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Δ Rule 22-806 2)
This Subrule is not intended to apply to internal fuses of equipment. It is intended to apply only to
distribution equipment and panelboards.

Sealing of the conduit systems will prevent the migration of corrosive vapours through the conduits
from the livestock area into the electrical panels, etc., that are located outside the livestock area.

Δ Rule 22-806 6)
Glass lamps can shatter and create sparks and ignition sources, or introduce glass shards into the
environment. Protection sleeves for glass tubes, or lamps constructed of a shatter-resistant material,
such as plastic, would be appropriate for use. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating should not be used
in poultry areas.

Δ Rule 22-808 2)
An oxide-inhibiting compound should be used on conductor terminations or splices, unless they are
suitable for use in a Category 2 location and so marked for use without oxide inhibitors. Equipment
manufacturers should be consulted to ensure that the compound is compatible with the conductor and
is appropriate for the application. Oxide-inhibiting compound is conductive and should be used
sparingly, and any excess compound should be removed.

Section 24
Rule 24-000
This Section consolidates requirements that arise from electrical safety considerations applicable to
specific areas in health care facilities.

Code users should consult CSA Z32 for further information regarding electrical safety and essential
electrical systems in health care facilities. CSA Z32 contains provisions that are supplementary to the
installation requirements specified in Sections 24 and 52 of this Code. These provisions include, for
example, the arrangement of normal and emergency power supply, classification of patient care areas,
classification of loads and branches of an essential electrical system, arrangements of normal and
emergency power supply sources for the loads of an essential electrical system, and the minimum
number of receptacles per patient care environment.

The content of this Section reflects the changing nature of health care. Procedures once reserved for
hospitals are now performed in medical clinics. As such, this Section applies to patient care areas in all
health care facilities, and its requirements are based on the care area (e.g., basic, intermediate, or
critical). This approach is consistent with the provisions of CSA Z32.
Rule 24-002
Hazard index
The hazard index with one isolated conductor connected to ground is not necessarily the same as the
hazard index with the other isolated conductor connected to ground; of the two, the greater hazard
index governs.

Patient care environment
The patient care environment is a zone fixed to the patient bed, table, or other supporting mechanism
and does not move with the patient as the patient moves through the health care facility or room.
Rule 24-100
Users of this Code should also consult CSA Z32, as it recommends additional precautions to take in the
design, construction, use, and maintenance of electrical systems in such areas.

It is highly desirable that the intended use of all patient care areas be designated by the health care
facility’s administration in a manner that may be readily understood by the facility’s staff.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 624



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rules 24-102 and 24-106
Basic care areas should not, even in long-term facilities, be considered residential occupancies that are
governed by general Rules such as 26-710 and 26-724. Users of this Code should be aware that the
need for circuits and receptacles in patient care areas is frequently greater than in most other locations.
Users are directed to CSA Z32 for recommendations regarding the minimum number of receptacles and
circuits normally required in the various patient care areas.
Rule 24-102 3)
This Subrule is not intended to restrict the number of patient care environments served by a branch
circuit. Users of this Code should consider the nature of the care area (e.g., basic, intermediate, or
critical), Table 6 of CSA Z32, and the voltage drop requirements of Rule 8-102. It is the intent that
receptacles supplied by the branch circuit supply only medical electrical equipment. The actual use of
the receptacle by health care facility staff within the patient care environment is beyond the scope
of this Subrule. The word “load” within this Subrule is intended to refer exclusively to permanently
connected medical electrical equipment or receptacles intended for medical electrical equipment.
Rule 24-102 4)
It is the intent of this Subrule to permit branch circuits to supply loads between two patient care
environments within the same patient care area.
Rule 24-102 5)
As indicated by Subrule 24-302 1), it is the responsibility of the health care facility administration to
designate which circuits, if any, are essential. Certain types of health care facilities (outpatient clinics,
doctors’ and dental offices, massage therapy offices, group homes, etc.) may not have a designated
essential electrical system. The intent of this Subrule is to make provision for such situations.
Rule 24-102 7)
It is intended by this Subrule that a branch circuit that supplies the receptacles and permanently
connected electrical equipment constituting loads of an essential electrical system as described in
Rule 24-300 not be permitted to supply other receptacles (such as housekeeping receptacles, etc.) that
are not required to be a part of the essential electrical system.

Loads constituting an essential electrical system of a health care facility are described in Clause 6 and
Table 6 of CSA Z32.
Rules 24-104 1) and 24-112
The object of these Rules is to limit the voltage difference in the vicinity of the patient and thus to
minimize the risk of electric shock. The adequacy of the installation may be verified by test in
accordance with the procedure outlined in CSA Z32. It is important to note the specifications of the
measurement instrument.

Bonding to ground in patient care areas must accomplish two functions:
a) limit the voltage that occurs on exposed metal parts in the event of a fault in the electrical

insulation of the wiring system or of a utilization device; and
b) eliminate small but potentially hazardous voltage differences that might otherwise exist between

grounded points in the vicinity of the patient.

To enable the integrity of the bonding conductor to be checked, the conductor should not be permitted
to make intermediate contact with grounded metal, as would be the case in metal conduit and in some
armoured cables.
Rule 24-104 1) b)
The bare bonding conductor of a Type AC90 cable is not considered suitable for the purpose.
Rules 24-104 2) and 24-112
It is intended that the bonding methods specified by these Rules may be mixed, i.e., some bonding
conductors for an area may be terminated at a grounding bus, and others may be terminated at the

panelboard. In some situations, “daisy chaining” of bonding conductors from outlet to outlet may prove
to be more effective than installing a separate conductor from each outlet to a common point.
Rule 24-104 5)
This Subrule is not intended to isolate the three-phase equipment bonding conductor from other
equipment within the patient care environment.
Rule 24-104 8)
This Subrule is intended to require that all exposed metal parts of non-electrical equipment located
within a patient care environment that could become energized during a single fault condition be
bonded to ground. Examples of such equipment are metal parts of medical gas equipment, metal parts
of support arms or consoles installed in a patient care environment, etc.

It is not intended by this Subrule that metal parts of portable non-electrical equipment or metal parts of
the building structure and miscellaneous small conductive parts (e.g., metal door frames, window
frames, and soap dishes) be bonded to ground.
Rule 24-104 9)
It is intended by this Subrule that the bonding of general-type recessed and surface-mounted luminaires
located more than 2.3 m above floor level and their associated switches located outside a patient care
environment, not be required to meet the bonding provisions of Section 24, but such luminaires and
switches must comply with the general bonding requirements of Section 10.

The relaxation provided by this Subrule is not intended for lighting equipment that may extend into the
patient care environment, such as surgical lights, stem-mounted examination light fixtures, ceiling-
mounted fixtures with a hinged and framed lens, etc., that are used for patient care as loads of the
essential electrical system.
Rule 24-106 1)
The extent of each type of patient care area is described in CSA Z32. Table 5 of CSA Z32 (reproduced
below) identifies the minimum number and general arrangement of receptacles in patient care areas,
based on the level of patient care.

2) The prescribed number of patient care receptacles per patient care environment should be located within the

patient care environment unless it is not practical for the intended application.
Rule 24-106 3)
Rule 26-704 requires that receptacles installed within 1.5 m of wash basins, bathtubs, or shower stalls
be protected by a ground fault circuit interrupter of the Class A type.
Rules 24-106 3) and 24-114
The intent of these Rules is to provide protection against electric shock hazard when personal grooming
appliances are being used. See also the Note to Rules 24-102 and 24-106.

Δ Rule 24-106 5)
It is intended by this Subrule to mandate installation of 15 A or 20 A non-locking hospital-grade
receptacles in all locations within a patient care area, including locations of tables, desks, or counters
used by staff performing care or treatment functions in the patient care area. Nursing stations may also
be located within some patient care areas, such as intensive care units, emergency wards, etc.

It is not intended by this Subrule to mandate installation of hospital-grade receptacles in bathrooms or
washrooms contained within a patient care area.
Rule 24-106 6)
CSA Z32 identifies receptacles and other loads that should be connected to the circuits in essential
electrical systems (i.e., those listed in Table 6 of CSA Z32 and considered essential for the life, safety,
and care of the patient and the effective operation of the health care facility during an interruption of
the normal electrical supply for any reason).
Rule 24-110
In intermediate and critical care areas, either grounded or isolated systems may be used. Users of this
Code should consult CSA Z32 regarding the relative merits of each system.

Rule 24-114
See the Note to Rules 24-106 3) and 24-114.
Rule 24-116
Areas subject to standing fluids on the floor or drenching of the work area can create a condition where
a patient or staff member can become a path for ground fault current under fault conditions.

Routine housekeeping procedures and incidental spillage of liquids are not intended to be considered
for the purpose of this Rule.

Use of receptacles protected by a ground fault circuit interrupter of a Class A type is intended for those
wet locations within a patient care area where interruption of power to the receptacles by actuation of
a ground fault circuit interrupter is deemed to be acceptable in accordance with the provisions of
CSA Z32.

These receptacles are intended to be supplied by an isolated system where such power interruption to
the receptacles is not acceptable in accordance with CSA Z32.
Rules 24-200, 24-202 2), and 24-204 7)
Users of this Code should recognize that while fixed luminaires and medical electrical equipment,
permanently connected or otherwise, identified in these Rules may physically be located outside the
patient care environment, they nonetheless serve the patient care environment.
Rule 24-204 6)
Users of this Code should refer to CSA Z32 regarding methods for verifying the impedance-to-ground of
an isolated system.
Rule 24-206
It is imperative that the impedance-to-ground of individually isolated branch circuits be tested at regular
intervals, and that maintenance procedures be instituted for the system and the equipment connected
to it as necessary to limit the hazard index to 2 mA.
Rule 24-208
Three-phase isolated systems should be subjected to a periodic test of the impedance-to-ground of the
system, together with any connected load, unless an isolation-sensing device (e.g., an isolation monitor)
is used.
Rule 24-300
Users of this Code are directed to CSA Z32, which makes further recommendations regarding the
design, installation, use, and maintenance of these systems.
Rule 24-302
CSA Z32 provides advice as to what loads should be supplied by the vital, delayed vital, or conditional
branch of an essential electrical system.
Rule 24-304
The intent of the requirement that transfer switches be mechanically held is to ensure that, once the
essential system has been connected to the emergency supply, it will not be disconnected until the
normal supply has been restored.

Section 26
Rule 26-004
Electrical equipment certified after September 30, 1986 is acceptable for mounting directly over
combustible surfaces without additional protection unless it bears a cautionary marking requiring
additional protection. Equipment certified prior to that date is not required to carry the cautionary
marking.

Rule 26-010
Dielectric liquid-filled circuit breakers or switches should have their vents piped directly to an outside
area in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions or recommendations.

Construction criteria for service rooms are provided in Articles 3.6.2.1 and 9.10.10.3 of the National

Rule 26-212
In addition to the circuit overcurrent protection provided by this Rule, overcurrent protection should be
provided for the capacitors to protect them against bursting if a unit becomes defective.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 630



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Where capacitors for power factor correction are assembled in the field to form banks or groups of
banks, the manufacturer’s instructions with respect to proper application and connection should be
obtained in order to ensure that such overcurrent protection is properly provided.

Generally, individual capacitor fusing or the single fusing of a capacitor bank is used. It becomes an
application engineering problem and involves the coordination of the time-current (i.e., blowing)
characteristics of the fuse with those of the container with respect to bursting caused by the generation
of gas pressure under fault conditions. The selection of the fuse also requires consideration to be given
to the available fault current of the circuit and to proper connection of the capacitors in the circuit (i.e.,
whether parallel, series-parallel, Y-connected with a floating neutral, etc.). Improper capacitor
connections can also cause overvoltage on adjacent units upon failure of a unit.
Rule 26-240 1) b)
The associated equipment of a unit substation, each contained in an enclosure designed and
constructed to restrict access to live parts, is deemed to comply with the requirements of
Rule 26-012 4) a).
Rule 26-244 2)
For the purposes of this Subrule, a non-propagating liquid is one that when subjected to a source of
ignition may burn, but the flame will not spread from the source of ignition. The flash point of a liquid is
the minimum temperature at which the liquid gives off sufficient vapour to form an ignitable mixture
with air near the surface of the liquid or within the test vessel used.
Rule 26-254
Selection of overcurrent devices with a rating too low for the primary of a dry-type transformer can
result in unintended operation when the transformer is being energized (such as might occur after a
power outage). To avoid such operation, the overcurrent device should be able to carry
a) 12 times the transformer rated primary full load current for 0.1 s; and
b) 25 times the transformer rated primary full load current for 0.01 s.
Rule 26-256 4)
Rule 26-256 1) and 2) mandates that the ampacity of primary and secondary conductors for
transformers be not smaller than 125% of the respective primary or secondary currents. It is intended
by Subrule 4) that if the primary overcurrent protection does not exceed 125% of the primary rated
current for dry transformers, such overcurrent protective devices will adequately protect transformers
and primary and secondary conductors, and that the fundamental provision of Rule 14-104 will be met.

The intent of Subrule 4) is to clarify that when the transformer circuit is protected by overcurrent
devices in accordance with Rule 26-250 1) or 2) or Rule 26-254 3), such overcurrent protection may not
be adequate for the purpose of Rules 14-100 and 14-104 (and of Table 13, where use of Table 13 is
applicable).
Rule 26-258
The intent of this requirement is to provide for coordination between loads connected to a transformer
secondary and the rating of the transformer circuit (i.e., rating of the transformer overcurrent device
and ampacity of transformer conductors). Compliance with this requirement allows the proper selection
of the minimum acceptable conductor size under the applicable provisions of Rule 26-256 and selection
of the transformer overcurrent device under the applicable requirements of Rules 26-250 to 26-254.

Because selection criteria for the overcurrent devices and conductors are based on the rated (primary
or secondary) current of the transformer, the actual calculated load connected to the transformer may
not necessarily fully correlate with the transformer rated primary and secondary currents, in which case
the intent of this requirement could be met by increasing the rating of the overcurrent device under the
relaxation permitted by Rule 26-254 3). This Rule would also have to be considered when conductor size
is permitted to be reduced under the provisions of Rule 26-256 3).

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 26-260 1)
The purpose of installing primary fuses between power lines and instrument voltage transformers is to
protect the power system from possible destructive power arc-over due to breakdown of the major
insulation of the transformers. Such fuses must have adequate interrupting capacity for the power
system to which they are connected, either self-contained or in conjunction with suitable current-
limiting resistors.
Rule 26-260 3) c)
The reference in this Item to primary terminals outside the enclosure being common to both voltage
transformers and current transformers includes the “centre” (common) phase primary terminals of
open-delta-connected voltage transformers and the primary grounded neutral terminal.
Rule 26-266
The neutral current to a zero sequence filter is three times the phase current.

Installation of a zero sequence filter can increase the single phase-to-ground fault current to 1.5 times
the available phase-to-phase fault current.
Rule 26-354
Construction requirements for electrical equipment vaults are found in Article 3.6.2.7 of the National
Building Code of Canada.

It is recommended, wherever practicable, that vaults be located where they can be ventilated directly
from and to an outside area without the use of flues or ducts. In order to minimize the possible
explosion hazard from gases that might seep into a vault, vaults should be located remote from points
where gas, sewer, water, and other pipelines and conduits enter the building. It is also recommended
that they not be located adjacent or close to vertical openings such as elevator shafts.
Rule 26-364
Because nitrocellulose film is known to be subject to exothermic decomposition, which may result in
the generation of combustible and usually poisonous gases, these requirements are necessary to retard
the possible migration of such gases, as well as to prevent the spread of fire or heated gases to other
vaults through raceways. For additional information, refer to NFPA 40.
Rule 26-420
Low-voltage surge protective devices (SPDs) or transient voltage surge suppressors are surge
suppression products designed for repeated suppression of transient voltage surges on 50 and 60 Hz
power circuits not exceeding 750 V. IEEE C62.41.1 and C62.41.2 describe three general categories of
operating environment for surge protective devices. The three system exposure environments are
Category A, Category B, and Category C. Surge rating for Category A is intended for outlets and long
branch circuits that exceed 10 m in length from Category B or 20 m in length from Category C. Surge
rating for Category B is intended for feeders and short branch circuits, distribution panels, heavy
appliance outlets with short connections to the service entrance, and lighting systems in large buildings.
Surge rating for Category C is intended for outdoor and service entrance installations, service drops
from a pole to a building, and underground lines to a well pump. The CSA C22.2 No. 269 series of
Standards covers five types of surge protective devices as described in Table B26-1.

Surge protective devices

Type of
surge
protective
device (SPD) Intended application and environment
1 • Permanently connected between the secondary of the service transformer and

the line side of the service equipment overcurrent device, as well as the load
side, including watt-hour meter socket enclosures, and intended to be installed
without an external overcurrent protective device

• Categories A, B, and C exposure environments
2 • Permanently connected on the load side of the service equipment overcurrent

device
• Categories A and B exposure environments

3 • Cord-connected or direct plug-in type incorporating Type 3 SPDs
• Receptacles* incorporating Type 3 SPDs connected at a minimum conductor or

cable length of 10 m from the electrical service panel to the point of utilization
• Category A* exposure environments

4 • A component assembly forming part of a Type 1, 2, or 3 SPD
• Not intended for field installation independent of a Type 1, 2, or 3 SPD

5 • A discrete component such as a metal oxide varistor (MOV), gas tube, or
avalanche diode

• Not intended for field installation
* Receptacle-type Type 3 surge protective devices that have been subjected to the nominal discharge current test
in CSA C22.2 No. 269.3 are suitable for use in Category B exposure environments and for permanent connection on
the load side of the service equipment overcurrent device.
Rule 26-602
Where in dwelling units, the branch circuit breakers are equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters
of the Class A type, panelboards containing these circuit breakers should be provided with a self-
adhesive label indicating the test procedure for the ground fault circuit interrupter and a chart for
recording the tests.

Δ Rule 26-652
Flood hazard zones are designated by local floodplain management regulations or local bylaws.

Δ Rule 26-656 b)
Where the National Building Code of Canada mandates the installation of smoke alarms or carbon
monoxide alarms in a “house with a secondary suite” (i.e., an additional dwelling unit created by
subdivision of a dwelling unit), these alarms are required to be interconnected so that activation of any
one alarm will cause all respective alarms to sound. The National Building Code of Canada recognizes
wired and wireless interconnection. This Subrule does not apply to wireless interconnection.

The intent of the warning labels is to provide adequate warning that shutting off the branch circuit in
the original dwelling unit will disconnect the respective smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms in the
additional dwelling unit, and that the panelboard in the additional dwelling unit does not disconnect the
respective smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms located within that dwelling unit.
Rule 26-658 1) and 2)
The intent of these Subrules is to provide both series (also called low-level) and parallel (also called
high-level) arc-fault protection downstream from the panelboard through the entire branch circuit
wiring, including cord sets and power supply cords connected to the outlets.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Considering that the outlet branch-circuit-type arc-fault circuit interrupter does not provide upstream
parallel arc-fault protection, Rule 26-658 2) b) requires mechanical protection for the portion of the
branch circuit between the branch circuit overcurrent device and the first outlet. The mechanical
protection minimizes the risk of direct contact with and damage to the cable that could cause ignition
due to an arc and spread of the flame should ignition occur.
Rule 26-658 2)
The intent of this Subrule can be met by installing
a) a combination-type arc-fault circuit interrupter located at the origin of the branch circuit; or
b) an outlet branch-circuit-type arc-fault circuit interrupter at the first added receptacle or upstream

from the added receptacle.
Rule 26-700 and Diagrams 1 and 2
The configurations of Diagrams 1 and 2 are all of the grounding type. With two exceptions (5-20RA and
6-20RA), these configurations are identical to those similarly designated in the United States,
dimensional details of which are given in ANSI/NEMA WD 6.

The CSA 5-20RA and 6-20RA configurations differ from those in the United States in that they will not
accept a 15 A attachment plug of the same voltage rating. Receptacles of the CSA 5-20R and 6-20R
configurations are intended to accommodate both 15 A and 20 A rated attachment plugs.

Δ Rules 26-700 8) and 26-704
The term “sink” is intended to include kitchen sinks, bar sinks, laundry sinks, utility room sinks, wash
basins, etc., that are connected to a plumbing drain pipe. It is not intended to include portable wash
basins.

It is not intended that the 1.5 m dimension be extended through a wall opening that is fitted with a
door. Where a room combines a wash basin or shower/bathing facilities with an area serving another
purpose, such as an ensuite bathroom in a bedroom, requirements for receptacles located in such
rooms or areas should be considered similar to the requirements for receptacles located in bathrooms
and washrooms.

It is also intended that no receptacle be located directly behind any sink unless the distance between
the wall and the inside edge of the sink exceeds 450 mm, such as in the case of a diagonal corner sink.
See Figure B26-2.

The requirement for Class A ground fault circuit interrupter protection is not intended to apply to
receptacles supplying appliances located behind such appliances as washers, dryers, fridges, ranges,
built-in microwaves, and other similar appliances, provided that those receptacles, by virtue of their
location, are rendered essentially inaccessible for use for other portable appliances.
Rule 26-702 2)
Receptacles can be protected by a Class A ground fault circuit interrupter that is
a) an integral part of the receptacle; or
b) incorporated in an upstream receptacle, dead-front device, or circuit breaker.

Δ Rule 26-704 2)
For receptacles intended for vehicle heater(s) installed in accordance with Rule 8-400 2), it should be
noted that CSA C22.2 No. 191 permits specified heaters with sheathed heating elements to leak 4 mA of
current for the first 10 min after power is applied. If two or more heaters are protected by the same
Class A GFCI device, the cumulative leakage current at power on may result in tripping. Tripping of the
GFCI device can also be an indication that replacement or maintenance of the heater(s) is required.
Rule 26-706
This Rule requires that only receptacles that are designed, constructed, and marked as tamper-resistant
receptacles, “TAMPER RESISTANT” or “TR”, in accordance with CSA C22.2 No. 42, be used in the
locations designated in Subrule 1).

The intent of the Rule is to protect children from shock if they tamper with receptacles accessible to
them. For those situations where the receptacle is inaccessible, a non-tamper-resistant receptacle may
be used. Examples of such situations where the receptacle is inaccessible are microwaves in cabinets,
refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, those located in an attic or crawl space, or those installed
above 2 m from the floor or finished grade.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 26-706 1) a)
It is intended by this Subrule that unless otherwise designated by an authority having jurisdiction for
child care facilities, a child care facility is considered to be an area designed to provide care to persons
7 years of age or less.
Rule 26-708
The Standard for wet location cover plates is CSA C22.2 No. 42.1.

The cover plates required for the receptacle configurations identified in Rule 26-708 2) are designed to
be suitable for use in wet locations whether or not a plug is inserted into the receptacle, i.e., tested for
resistance to moisture both with a plug inserted and without a plug inserted into the receptacle. These
plates are required to be marked “Wet Locations” with the marking being visible after installation.

Other wet location cover plates suitable for use in wet locations only when the plug is removed, i.e.,
tested for resistance to moisture only without a plug inserted into the receptacle, may be used with
other receptacle configurations not identified in Rule 26-708 2) and are required to be marked “Wet
Location Only When Cover Closed”, or the equivalent, with the marking being visible after installation.
Rule 26-708 2) and 3)
It is intended by Rule 26-708 3) b) to recognize the protection provided by soffits, overhanging
balconies, canopies, marquees, roofed open porches, and similar architectural elements from
precipitation that may drip, splash, or flow on or against receptacles located outdoors, thus reducing
the environmental protection requirement to damp locations. To determine if a receptacle location is
damp, not wet, a zone defined in its borders by a 45° line from the roof edge and a horizontal line at
least 1 m off finished grade or floor level is conceptualized as shown in Figure B26-3. Subrules 26-708 2)
and 3) are intended to apply to outlets in the areas identified in Figure B26-3 as follows:
a) Area 1 — An “in-use” cover that is marked “Extra-duty” and is suitable for wet locations is

required. A cover marked “Wet Location Only When Cover Closed”, not of the “in-use” type, is
permitted for receptacles facing downward 45° or less.

b) Area 2 — A cover marked “Wet Location Only When Cover Closed”, not of the “in-use” type, is
permitted.

When a plug is inserted into the receptacle, a wet location cover plate marked “Extra Duty” provides
the intended protection only when the cover is closed. For this reason, an “Extra Duty” wet location
cover plate may also be marked “Wet Location Only When Cover Closed”. Covers of wet location cover
plates that are not marked “Extra Duty” (formerly referred to as weatherproof cover plates) cannot be
closed when a plug is inserted into the receptacle; consequently, cover plates that are not marked
“Extra Duty” should be installed only in damp or dry locations such as described in Rule 26-708 3) a)
and b).

Δ Rule 26-710
The maximum distance of 7.5 m is intended to ensure that a standard 10 m long extension cord will
reach the rooftop equipment. The minimum 750 mm clearance from the finished roof is intended to
ensure that the receptacle remains visible in the event of snow buildup.

Some maintenance procedures may require that receptacles with a higher current or voltage rating be
provided in addition to that specified in the Rule.

Δ Rule 26-712 a)
Flood hazard zones are designated by local floodplain management regulations or by local bylaws.

Δ Rule 26-712 b)
It is intended by this requirement that a sump pump receptacle located below the flood elevation
should be only of such design and construction that will allow the receptacle to safely and reliably
operate if it is submersed in water.

Δ Rule 26-720 k)
CSA C22.2 No. 320, which applies to controlled outlets, defines a controlled outlet as “an outlet that has
an integral switching means to allow remote switching of the connected load”.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Controlled outlets are marked with the words “Controlled” or the following symbol:

Controlled

Controlled outlets are typically used to remotely switch power fed through a receptacle to a connected
load as part of a building automation or energy management system.
Rule 26-720 l)
For the purposes of this Subrule, the installation of the duct should be considered complete when
enough duct has been installed to allow identification of the central vacuum unit location.
Rule 26-720 n)
It is intended by this requirement to recognize a need for additional electric vehicle charging
infrastructure in residential occupancies only in those cases where such electric vehicle charging
infrastructure is mandated by the provincial/territorial building codes or local building or zoning
regulations.

Users of this Code should consult local building or zoning bylaws for electric vehicle charging
infrastructure requirements and for the number of dedicated receptacles for electric vehicle charging
equipment required as a percentage of the total parking spaces for cars in a residential occupancy.
Rule 26-722 a)
In laying out the location of receptacle outlets in residential premises, consideration should be given to
the placement of electric baseboard heaters, hot air registers, and hot water or steam registers to avoid
having cords pass over hot or conductive surfaces wherever possible.
Rule 26-722 d) iv) and v)
It is intended by these Items that a continuous counter surface is one that is not interrupted by sinks,
ranges, and other built-in equipment.
Rule 26-722 d) v)
A peninsular countertop is measured from the connecting edge.
Rule 26-724 a)
For single dwellings of the detached, semi-detached, and row housing types, it is recommended that
outdoor receptacles be placed at both the front and rear of the house and that these be controlled by a
switch located inside the house.
Rule 26-744 10)
Some permanently connected appliances are provided with multiple points of supply as permitted by
the applicable safety Standard for electrical equipment and are marked accordingly.
Rule 26-804
The following are excerpts from CSA C22.2 No. 3:

4.8.5 The nominal supply voltage of a safety control circuit shall not exceed 120 V.

4.8.6 A safety control circuit intended to be supplied by a nominal 120 V branch circuit shall comply
with the following:
a) the circuit shall not be grounded within the equipment;
b) the ungrounded conductor shall have an overcurrent protection device rated at not more than

125% of the current drawn by the circuit, except that this value may be increased because of
inrush currents and ambient temperatures. These requirements shall apply only where the

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

maximum current to the appliance exceeds 12 A and the safety controls are in series with the
total load they control.

4.8.7 A safety control circuit supplied other than as specified in Clause 4.8.6, such as one supplied
by a battery or a transformer, shall comply with the following:
a) it shall be a 2-wire circuit not exceeding 120 V;
b) one side of the circuit shall be grounded;
c) except for the condition specified in Item d), the ungrounded conductor shall have an

overcurrent protection device rated at not more than 125% of the current drawn by the circuit,
except that for circuits drawing currents up to and including 2 A the protection shall be rated at
not more than 200%. These values may be increased because of inrush currents and ambient
temperatures; and

d) a safety control circuit supplied by a Class 2 transformer shall not require overcurrent
protection.

4.8.8 A safety control shall interrupt the current in the ungrounded conductor of the circuit
between the overcurrent protection and the load.

4.8.9 Except for multiphase loads and circuits in which the load to be controlled exceeds the contact
rating of the safety control*, safety controls that open an electrical circuit to the burner or to the
shut-off device shall directly open the circuit regardless of whether the switching mechanism is
integral with, or remote from, the sensing element.

* In these instances, the safety control may interrupt the coil circuit of a magnetic relay or contactor,
which in turn directly opens the circuit to the burner or shut-off device.

The purpose of this requirement is to minimize the interposing of other controls in the safety control
circuit, the failure of which might create an unsafe condition that the safety control is intended to
prevent.
Rule 26-806 1)
Subrule 1) is intended to apply only to central heating equipment that does not use electricity as the
source of heat. It is not intended to apply to electrical components of non-electric heating equipment
such as water heaters, fireplace inserts, room heaters, or other similar auxiliary heating equipment that
has electric auto-ignition, controls, or blower motors rated not more than 1/8 hp.

Δ Rule 26-956
Polyethylene water pipe is not an approved electrical conduit suitable for this purpose. High-density
polyethylene (HDPE) conduit is similar in construction to water piping and certified to
CSA C22.2 No. 327 as a non-metallic conduit that would meet the requirements of this Rule.

Section 28
Example to determine motor insulated conductors and protection
The following is a sample calculation for determining copper conductor size and overcurrent and
overload protection for one 100 hp, one 30 hp, and two 7-1/2 hp motors, 575 V, three-phase, at full-
voltage start.

Conductors
It is necessary to determine the motor full load currents, preferably from the motor nameplate, or from
Table 44. Conductor sizes for the individual motors (see Rule 28-106 and Table 2) are as follows:

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 639



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

100 hp 30 hp 7-1/2 hp
Full load current (from Table 44) 99 A 32 A 9 A
125% calculation 124 A 40 A 11 A
From Table 2

75 °C insulated conductors No. 1 No. 8 No. 14
90 °C insulated conductors No. 1 No. 8 No. 14

Feeder insulated conductor ampacity [see Rule 28-108 1) a)]
Insulated conductor ampacity is calculated as 125% of 99 A plus 32 A plus 2 times 9 A equals 174 A for
the four motors. Conductor size from Table 2 is No. 4/0 AWG for 60 °C insulated conductors and
No. 2/0 AWG for 75 or 90 °C insulated conductors.

Protection
Overload protection
The maximum allowable setting of overload devices is determined from Rule 28-306. Assuming a 1.15
service factor, the ratings are 123.8 A for the 100 hp motor, 40 A for the 30 hp motor, and 11.3 A for the
7-1/2 hp motors.

Overcurrent protection
Branch circuit overcurrent protection for each motor is determined by using Rule 28-200. For the
purpose of the motors described, use Rule 28-200 a) and Table 29. Listed below are actual currents with
the standard size protector shown in brackets.

100 hp 30 hp 7-1/2 hp
Time-delay fuse 99 × 175% = 174 A 32 × 175% = 56 A 9 × 175% = 15.8 A

(150) (50) (15)
Non-time-delay fuse 99 × 300% = 297 A 32 × 300% = 96 A 9 × 300% = 27.0 A

(250) (90) (25)
Inverse-time circuit 99 × 250% = 248 A 32 × 250% = 80 A 9 × 250% = 22.5 A
breaker (225) (80) (20)

Note that Table D16 may be used to select the size of overcurrent devices in accordance with
Rule 28-200, where the full load current rating of the motor is shown in the Table.

Feeder overcurrent protection
The maximum allowable feeder overcurrent protection for motors is determined from Rule 28-204.

Using Rule 28-204 1), the ratings are as shown below, with the standard size shown in parentheses:

Time-delay fuse 174 + 32 + 9 + 9 = 224 A (200)
Non-time-delay fuse 297 + 32 + 9 + 9 = 347 A (300)
Inverse-time circuit 248 + 32 + 9 + 9 = 298 A (250)

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 28-104
Rule 4-006 does not apply to conductors terminating on motors because Rule 28-104 3) allows sizing of
conductors for Class A motors based on a 90 °C conductor insulation rating. However, the Code user
should be aware that the conductor termination temperature requirements of Rule 4-006 do apply to
conductors that are terminated on supply or control equipment.
Rule 28-200 2) e)
In CSA C22.2 No. 14, a motor controller having non-replaceable or integral discriminating overload and
short-circuit current sensors, and provided with one or more sets of contacts where the contacts cannot
be isolated for separate testing, is considered to be a self-protected combination motor controller.
Rule 28-210
Instantaneous-trip circuit breakers are a magnetic-only trip device without time delay that may be
provided with a dampening means to accommodate the transient motor inrush current.
Rule 28-210 a)
The intent of this Item is to allow an increase in the trip setting above 1300% for motors with high
locked rotor currents that will trip on the asymmetrical inrush at the 1300% rating. For example, a
motor with 800% locked rotor current would result in a trip setting of up to 1720% of full load current.
Higher locked rotor currents are common in energy-efficient motors.
Rule 28-212
Power electronic devices such as adjustable speed drives (ASDs), variable frequency drives (VFDs), or
solid-state contactors may be additionally protected by semiconductor fuses. These power electronic
controllers are required to be approved with such fuses mounted integral to the device. Semiconductor
fuses are components recognized in accordance with CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 248.13 and provide short-
circuit protection but may not provide overload protection.
Rule 28-304
There are several conditions that may create current imbalance in three-phase motor circuits of
sufficient magnitude to overload one or more phase insulated conductors of the circuit. When the
overload occurs in only one of the three insulated conductors, a current-sensitive element is necessary
in each insulated conductor of the circuit to protect the motor against burnout, since two such
elements will not protect it if the overload is in the third or unprotected insulated conductor. Among
the conditions that may create this situation are
a) single phasing in the primary of wye-delta or delta-wye connected transformers feeding the

motors;
b) a single-phase load taken from the same circuit that feeds the motor, where one of the phases

feeding the single-phase load is open;
c) a single-phase load fed from the same feeder that serves the motor, where the line drop is not

negligible. No single-phase condition is necessary in this case to create current imbalance that may
overload one phase of the motor; and

d) a large and a small motor fed from the same feeder, in which single phasing occurs. The small
motor may be damaged, since it attempts to act as a phase converter to maintain current balance
in the larger motor.

Rule 28-306
The manufacturer’s instructions should be consulted to determine how to match the trip setting or
rating information to the motor full load current rating.
Rule 28-308 c)
The intent of this Item is to allow motors that are designed, constructed, certified to CSA C22.2 No. 77,
and marked as impedance “ZP” and thermally “TP” protected motors to be installed without the
overload protection that is required by Rule 28-300.
Rule 28-314
See the Note to Rules 18-106 and 28-314.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 642



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 28-316
The abbreviations “TP” and “ZP” may be used for marking “Thermally Protected” and “Impedance
Protected”, respectively, on motors having less than 100 W input.
Rule 28-400
Upon the inspection of an installation, if it is the opinion of an inspector that automatic restarting of
such motor-operated machinery as saws, routers, millers, wood and metal turning lathes, conveyors, or
other moving machinery would create a hazard on return of voltage after stopping due to failure of
voltage, the motor control device will be required to provide low-voltage protection.
Rule 28-602
A motor branch circuit disconnecting means is required to be located in close proximity to the branch
circuit overcurrent device(s); therefore, the use of fused motor-circuit switches or circuit breakers is
obvious. Unfused motor-circuit switches, moulded case switches, and instantaneous-trip circuit
interrupters, etc., are often used in certain switchgear and control gear, along with a separate
overcurrent or overload device(s), to meet this requirement.
Rule 28-602 1) d)
An approved combination motor controller, including a self-protected control device, is a type of
equivalent device that is suitable for use as the motor branch circuit disconnecting means.
Rule 28-602 3) b)
The use of a manually operated across-the-line type of motor controller that serves as both a starter
and disconnecting means is limited by Rule 28-602 3) b) to the following:
a) the manual across-the-line controller is part of an approved combination controller, motor control

unit, or controller that also includes the overcurrent protection as required by Rules 28-200 and
28-202; or

b) the manual across-the-line controller is used on the load side of the branch circuit overcurrent
protection.

A manual motor starter marked “Suitable for Motor Disconnect” is certified for use with overcurrent
protection on the line side of the switch. Contact welding or other damage may result when overcurrent
protection, located on the load side of the motor starter, opens (interrupts a fault current). Overcurrent
devices, including those that may be integral to the equipment, are not intended to be installed on the
load side of a manual motor starter that is marked “Suitable for Motor Disconnect”.
Rule 28-900
The intent of this Rule is to provide disconnecting means that will completely disconnect a generator
from all circuits supplied by the generator. It is not intended by this requirement to mandate installation
of such disconnecting means if provided with a generator constructed in conformance with CSA C22.2
No. 100 or when the generator is part of an emergency power supply system conforming to CSA C282.

CSA C282 requires a disconnecting means and overcurrent protection for an emergency generator.

Section 30
Rule 30-002
Cabinet lighting system
The intent of this definition is to describe a complete, extra-low-voltage cabinet lighting system that is
packaged by the manufacturer and intended for installation in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Convertible luminaire
The following is the definition of a convertible luminaire as provided in CSA C22.2 No. 250.0:

Convertible luminaire — a recessed luminaire that can be converted by the installer from a
Type Non-IC to a Type IC or from a Type IC to a Type Non-IC recessed luminaire.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Section 32
Rule 32-000
For further information pertaining to the installation of fire alarm systems, reference should be made to
CAN/ULC-S524.

It is essential that fire alarm systems be maintained in an operating condition at all times. The
inspection, maintenance, and testing procedures are detailed in the National Fire Code of Canada or the
appropriate provincial fire code.

For further information pertaining to the installation of fire pumps, reference should be made to
NFPA 20.

Δ Rule 32-200
The intent of this Rule is to provide requirements for permanently connected smoke alarms and carbon
monoxide alarms.

The National Building Code of Canada recognizes smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms as life
safety devices. It is intended by this Rule that wiring of smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms
(including interconnection of smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms, which utilizes a Class 2 power
supply) is required to comply with the applicable provisions of Section 12, and that use of conductors
for Class 2 circuit wiring described by Rule 16-210 is not permitted for interconnection of smoke alarms
or carbon monoxide alarms.

While the National Building Code of Canada requires that smoke alarms be permanently connected to
an electrical circuit, it recognizes that a carbon monoxide alarm may be permanently connected to the
electrical circuit or be supplied from batteries.

It is also the intent that 120 V smoke alarms conforming to CAN/ULC-S531 or 120 V carbon monoxide
alarms conforming to CSA 6.19 be installed on a branch circuit that supplies lighting or a mix of lighting
and receptacles in each dwelling unit and in each sleeping room that is not within a dwelling unit.

Δ Rule 32-200 1) a) and b)
It is not intended by this Subrule to allow smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms to be installed in a
branch circuit supplying receptacles only.

Δ Rule 32-300
The intent of this Rule is to protect the insulated feeder conductors between a fire pump and an
emergency power source from fire damage.

The National Building Code of Canada requires that insulated conductors supplying life and fire safety
equipment be protected against exposure to fire to ensure continued operation of this equipment for a
period not less than 1 h.

NFPA 20 also mandates protection of circuits feeding fire pumps against possible damage by fire.

Specific requirements pertaining to the protection of conductors against exposure to fire can be found
in Article 3.2.7.10 of the National Building Code of Canada or in the appropriate provincial/territorial
legislation.
Rule 32-302
Consideration should be given to the location, routing, and design of wiring to minimize hazards that
might cause failure due to explosions, floods, fires, icing, vandalism, and other adverse external
conditions that might impair the function of a fire pump.
Rule 32-306
The intent of this Rule is to allow only a circuit breaker lockable in the closed position and identified as
the fire pump disconnecting means to be installed upstream from the fire pump controller in a normal
power supply circuit, or upstream from the fire pump transfer switch in an emergency power supply

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 646



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

circuit. This Rule also allows for the possibility of this circuit breaker being used in the fire pump service
box described in Rule 32-304.

This Rule requires that an overcurrent protective device for a fire pump be set to enable uninterrupted
operation under fire pump starting conditions. Such overcurrent protective devices are installed
upstream from the fire pump controller or the fire pump transfer switch and must have this capability
whether they form part of the normal power supply feeder or the emergency power supply feeder.

Fire pump locked rotor currents are typically not less than 500% of the full load current, and fire pump
suppliers should be consulted to determine the specific locked rotor current of a fire pump selected for
a specific installation. The overcurrent device settings described in Subrule 4) should be able to carry
the locked rotor current indefinitely, as required by NFPA 20. The overcurrent device settings described
in Subrule 5) should be coordinated with the integral overcurrent protection of the fire pump controller
or the transfer switch in such a manner that upstream overcurrent devices will not disconnect the
circuit prior to the operation of the controller/fire pump transfer switch overcurrent protection.

The intent of Subrule 6) is to recognize that NFPA 20 allows for the generator main circuit breaker to be
bypassed by a direct connection between the emergency supply feeder and the fire pump transfer
switch. This permission removes the requirement for coordination between the generator main circuit
breaker and the fire pump feeder circuit breaker as required by Rule 46-208 1).

It should also be noted that NFPA 20 requires that the circuit breaker in the controller or in the transfer
switch must have an instantaneous-trip setting of not more than 20 times the full load current. NFPA 20
also requires that the overcurrent device in a fire pump controller or in a fire pump transfer switch must
carry a minimum of 300% of the fire pump full load current for a period of 8 to 20 s.

Δ Rule 32-308
Annex E of CSA C22.2 No. 178.1 requires fire pump power transfer switches to be marked “Fire Pump
Power Transfer Switch″.
Rule 32-312
For the purpose of this Rule, a fire pump circuit is defined as the circuit supplied from the emergency
power source referred to in Rule 32-300, or the circuit supplied from a separate service box for fire
pump equipment in accordance with Rule 32-304.

Section 34
Rule 34-200
The enclosure should be constructed to prevent the emission of flames or any burning or ignited
material. Openings for ventilation should be arranged to be at least 100 mm from live parts.

Metal sign enclosures should be not less than 0.68 mm thick (22 MSG). At the point where it is intended
that the supply connections be made, the sign enclosure should be not less than 1.34 mm thick
(16 MSG). Each enclosure housing a neon supply, transformer, or other components should be marked
in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.

For neon supplies, the enclosure volume should be three times the volume of the transformer and/or
internal box.

Section 36
Rule 36-000 4)
Gas-filled high-voltage switchgear and control gear enclosures may not be subject to regulation or
inspection by local boiler and pressure vessel authorities. Equipment owners and electrical inspectors
should be cognizant of such circumstances and take the necessary precautions to ensure the installation
of safe and reliable equipment. Compliance with the following manufacturing Standards for the design,
construction, testing, inspection, and certification of enclosures is recommended:

Rule 36-006 1)
For a small access gate intended for foot traffic, a warning notice should typically be mounted on the
gate. For a large vehicle access gate that may remain open for periods of time during construction work,
consideration should be given to mounting the warning notice on the station fence adjacent to the gate
lock for improved visibility under all situations.
Rule 36-100 4)
The marking must be designed to draw attention to the location and nature of the embedded
equipment; it also must be indelible and easily legible through the use of such materials as metal
markers and dye markings.
Rule 36-104
Any fabric tape, semi-conducting or otherwise, over the insulation should be removed completely with
the metal shielding and the surface of the insulation thoroughly cleaned to remove any current-carrying
residue. At all terminations and joints, stress cones should be made and adequate leakage distance
provided from bare live parts. Electrical continuity of the metal shielding should be maintained across
insulated joints.

Grounding should be effected at several convenient points if possible. The manufacturer’s instructions
and kits, if necessary, should be made available with each order of shielded cable to ensure proper
installation.

Δ Rule 36-208
The application of Item b) is intended where continuous feedback from another source is possible as
described in the Note to Rule 36-214 3), or in arrangements where the switching configuration could
connect a single power source to either side of the fuses (such as double-ended substations). See also
Rules 36-006 and 36-214.

Δ Rule 36-214 3)
It is intended by this requirement that a visible point of disconnection, meeting the requirements of
Subrule 2), is provided for each potential source of feedback only if that source could continuously
energize the high-voltage equipment while all other sources are disconnected.

All sources of feedback in the installation should be considered, including low-voltage power sources
capable of energizing the high-voltage sections by feedback through a transformer, and any other
permanent or temporary sources.

It is not intended that this requirement apply to power sources that may be capable of momentary
transient feedback where such sources incorporate automatic isolation protective means. Examples of

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

such sources include, but are not limited to, capacitors with built-in discharge mechanisms, generators
connected through closed-transition transfer switches with backfeed protection, and distributed
resources such as photovoltaic systems connected through interactive inverters that are equipped with
anti-islanding protection in accordance with Rule 84-008.

Where a group-operated isolating switch is used to provide a visible point of disconnection in
accordance with Subrule 2), it is not intended that this switch be located immediately adjacent to the
load break devices referred to in this Subrule. For low-voltage feedback sources, the visible point of
disconnection could be part of the low-voltage system.

Installation and maintenance procedures for high-voltage switchgear frequently involve scenarios where
some sections may be isolated while other sections remain energized and accessible from the isolated
sections. Switchgear bus arrangements and potential power sources need to be well understood, and
safe work practices followed.
Rules 36-300 and 36-308 and Table 51
The conductor sizes shown in Table 51 are the minimum required to prevent conductor damage due to
heating of the conductor.

Precautions should be taken where other factors are to be considered, particularly the intended
application and class of use. Reference to IEEE 80, IEEE 837, and CSA C22.2 No. 41 may be necessary to
select appropriate devices and material. Special attention should be paid to downleads, as they may be
subjected to the total fault current passed into the grid.
Rule 36-302 1) a)
Grounding rods are manufactured and certified to CSA C22.2 No. 41. It is intended by this Item that the
designer of the station ground electrode will verify for each installation that the selected diameter and
length of the ground rod are sufficient in order to comply with Rule 36-304.

The diameter may vary depending on the material chosen. The minimum diameter and length values
should be used in preference to nominal values in the validation of compliance.
Rule 36-302 2)
Any station grounding system that has been designed in a manner other than as required by these Rules
should be documented and signed by an engineer in addition to being subject to acceptance in
accordance with Rule 2-030.
Rule 36-302 6)
IEEE 80 should be consulted for conductor sizing to prevent thermal damage to the rebar during fault
conditions.
Rule 36-304 3)
The procedure specified in this Subrule for a station ground electrode design can be found in
CEA 249 D541.
Rule 36-308
See the Note to Rules 36-300 and 36-308 and Table 51.
Rule 36-308 6)
For solidly grounded systems, the size of the transformer secondary grounding conductor should be not
less than No. 2/0 AWG. Where a neutral resistance or impedance grounding device is used, grounding
conductors may be sized in accordance with Rule 10-308.

Rule 38-002
The control system hardware is permitted to be located in a single enclosure or a combination of
enclosures, including the separate functions of motor control, motion control, and operational control.
Rule 38-003
See CSA B44.1/ASME A17.5 for voltage limitations within equipment.

Δ Rule 38-013
The heating of insulated conductors depends on rms current values, which, with generator field control,
are reflected by the nameplate current rating of the motor-generator driving motor rather than by the
rating of the driving machine motor, which represents actual but short-time and intermittent full load
current values.

Δ Rule 38-013 2) a)
Driving machine motor currents, or those of similar functions, may exceed the nameplate value, but
since they are inherently intermittent duty, and the heating of the motor and insulated conductors is
dependent on the rms current value, insulated conductors are sized for duty cycle service as required by
Rule 28-106 and Table 27.

Δ Rule 38-013 2) b)
It is intended by Item b) that the motor controller nameplate current rating be permitted to be derived
based on the rms value of the motor current using an intermittent duty cycle and other control system
loads, if applicable.
Rule 38-013 2) c)
The nameplate current rating of a power transformer supplying a motor controller reflects the
nameplate current rating of the motor controller at line voltage (transformer primary).
Rule 38-021 1) a) ii), 2) a), and 3) a)
Only electrical protective devices as required by ASME A17.1/CSA B44 and CSA B355 are recognized as
devices that can introduce a direct life hazard. (See Rule 16-010.)

If a life hazard can occur, Class 2 cables are not permitted. Cables suitable for Class 1 extra-low-voltage
circuits are permitted, such as communication cable, fire alarm and signal cable, multi-conductor
jacketed thermoplastic-insulated cable, and hard-usage and extra-hard-usage cable (see Table 19).
Rule 38-023
See ASME A17.1/CSA B44 and CSA B355 for illumination levels.

It is not intended that devices that have machine or control spaces incorporated within the equipment,
e.g., stair chairlifts that have the machine built into the chair housing, need to have separate lighting
and receptacles within that space (housing).
Rule 38-024
See ASME A17.1/CSA B44 for illumination levels.
Rule 38-041
Unsupported length for the hoistway suspension means is the length of cable measured from the point
of suspension in the hoistway to the bottom of the loop, with the elevator car located at the bottom
landing. Unsupported length for the car suspension means is the length of cable measured from the
point of suspension on the car to the bottom of the loop, with the elevator car located at the top
landing.

Δ Rule 38-051
In order to completely isolate all insulated control conductors in the circuits to a machine operating as
one of a group, it is necessary to disconnect all the selector or programming circuitry, thereby taking all
the other cars out of service. Not only is it impractical to shut down all cars in order to service one, it is
often necessary to locate troubles by checking the performance of components with the controller

Rule 40-020 2)
An access catwalk, designed for crane operators and maintenance trades personnel to access a crane
for operation, maintenance, and repair, is considered a working surface.
Rule 40-024 1)
In the case of equipment supplied by contact conductors, metal-to-metal contact between wheels and
tracks may constitute effective grounding when a low impedance grounding path is ensured. Where
local conditions, such as paint or other insulating material, prevent reliable metal-to-metal contact
between wheels and tracks, a separate bonding conductor must be provided for bonding to ground.

Section 42
Δ Rule 42-004 1)

This Subrule permits the receptacles for cord-connected welders to have lower ratings than the
overcurrent devices protecting the branch circuits supplying them, provided that the receptacle has a
rating not less than the rated primary current of each cord- and plug-connected welder.

Δ Rule 42-004 2)
The type of welder (e.g., transformer arc, motor-generator arc, resistance) will determine conductor size
and overcurrent protection requirements that differ from one type to another and that may allow
overcurrent protection that is rated higher than the rating of the receptacle. It is important that these
receptacles are used for no other purpose than their intended application and, therefore, be labelled
accordingly.

Section 46
Rule 46-000
This Section is intended to apply to the installation, operation, and maintenance of emergency power
supplies, such as batteries or generators, that are required by the National Building Code of Canada to
provide emergency power for the operation of life safety systems.

This Section is also intended to govern wiring methods between the emergency power supply and
emergency lights, exits signs, or life safety systems where the emergency power supply, emergency
lights, exit signs, or life safety systems are mandated by the National Building Code of Canada.

This Section is not intended to prohibit connection of loads other than the National Building Code of
Canada required emergency lights, exit signs, or life safety systems to the emergency power system
mandated by the National Building Code of Canada, provided that all applicable requirements for wiring
methods described in this Section are met.
Rule 46-002
The intent of this Rule is to correlate the special terminology of this Section with the descriptions in the
National Building Code of Canada of an emergency power supply and life safety systems (see
Subsection 3.2.7 of the National Building Code of Canada).
Rule 46-108

conductors and cables used in conjunction with emergency equipment (see Section 3.2.6 of the
National Building Code of Canada).
Rule 46-108 4)
The intent of this Subrule is to keep the wiring between the National Building Code of Canada required
emergency power supply and the National Building Code of Canada required electrically connected exit
signs or life safety systems entirely independent of all other wiring, including wiring to other loads that
are connected to the emergency power supply.

Δ Rule 46-108 5)
The intent of this Subrule is to keep the wiring between the National Building Code of Canada required
emergency power supply and life safety systems entirely independent of all wiring to other loads that
are connected to the emergency power supply, except where necessary in enclosures for splitters that
are provided for connection between the emergency power supply overcurrent device and
a) a separate disconnecting means and overcurrent device for a feeder supplying a transfer switch for

equipment that does not fall within the definition of “life safety systems” in this Section;
b) a separate circuit breaker for a feeder supplying a fire pump transfer switch in conformance with

Rules 32-306 4) and 32-308; and
c) except for a fire pump circuit breaker, a separate disconnecting means and the overcurrent device

for a feeder supplying a transfer switch for equipment that falls within the definition of “life safety
systems” in this Section. See Figure B46-1.

For installations where, in accordance with CSA C282, a single emergency generator in one building
provides an emergency power supply to a site consisting of multiple buildings, this Subrule intends that
a distribution arrangement, as shown in Figure B46-2, be provided for the loads located in each building
at the site supplied by the single emergency generator.

Unit equipment is not to be confused with other emergency lighting equipment certified by CSA as
emergency lighting units. Such emergency lighting units do not bear the above marking but are marked
“ELECTRICAL ONLY” and “CERTIFIÉ DU POINT DE VUE ÉLECTRIQUE SEULEMENT”, adjacent to the CSA
mark.
Rule 46-306 1)
Where approved unit equipment includes a list of lamps suitable for remote installations, the
requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 141 take into account a voltage drop of 5% in the remote lamp’s circuit
unless the list specifies that certain lamps conform to the requirements with a greater voltage drop.

Table D4 can be used to determine approximate permissible circuit lengths.
Rule 46-306 2)
The requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 141 are designed to ensure that any lamps forming part of the
equipment, or specified in a list provided with the equipment as suitable for remote connection, will not
exhibit an undue diminution of light intensity during the emergency period.

Δ Rule 46-400
This Rule applies to exit signs containing electrically connected luminaires (internally illuminated exit
signs) and to luminaires used to illuminate exit signs not directly connected to an electrical circuit
(externally illuminated exit signs). It is intended by this Rule that each electrically connected exit sign
represents approved electrical equipment conforming to CSA C22.2 No. 141.

It is also intended by this Rule that where an externally illuminated exit sign is installed in accordance
with Article 3.4.5.1 of the National Building Code of Canada, circuitry serving lighting used to illuminate
such externally illuminated exit signs is installed in compliance with Subrules 1) and 3).

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

The National Building Code of Canada recognizes externally illuminated exit signs that are constructed
in conformance with CAN/ULC-S572.
Rule 46-400 2)
The circuit supplying emergency lighting could be ac or dc. The National Building Code of Canada
requires that exit signs be illuminated continuously. Caution should be taken to ensure that a circuit
supplying both emergency lighting and exit signs is not controlled by a switch, time clock, or other
means.

Section 54
Rule 54-004
A community antenna distribution system consists of a coaxial cable wiring system for the purpose of
distributing radio and television frequency signals to and within premises. This distribution system is
commonly known as a community antenna television or cable TV (CATV) system. Where other than a
coaxial cable wiring system is employed, the requirements of Section 56 or 60 prevail.

Δ Rule 54-200 1)
The point at which the exposed cables enter a building is considered to be the point of emergence
through an exterior wall, a concrete floor slab, or from a totally enclosed non-combustible entrance
raceway.
Rule 54-202 b)
The point of cable entry into a building is considered to be the point of emergence through an exterior
wall, through a concrete floor slab, or from a totally enclosed non-combustible entrance raceway.

Section 56
Rules 56-200 1) and 56-202 1)
The intent of Rules 56-200 1) and 56-202 1) is to allow installation of non-conductive and conductive
optical fiber cables in raceways, including cable trays, provided that the other requirements in
Section 56 are met and such cables are listed in Table 19.
Rule 56-208
Where hybrid cables are installed in a vertical shaft, they should be located in a totally enclosed
non-combustible raceway, as these cables are classed as electrical cables in conformance with
Rule 56-204 2).

Conductive and non-conductive cables should be allowed to be installed in a vertical shaft of a building
of combustible or non-combustible construction without a totally enclosed non-combustible raceway,
provided that these cables will meet the flame spread requirements for buildings of non-combustible
construction. CSA marking for wires and cables meeting the flame spread requirements for the National
Building Code of Canada for installation in buildings of non-combustible construction is FT4.
Rule 56-214
The point at which the exposed conductive optical fiber cables enter a building is considered to be the
point of emergence through an exterior wall, through a concrete floor slab, or from a totally enclosed
non-combustible entrance raceway.

Rule 58-300
See Rules 28-312 and 28-400.

Δ Rule 58-608
Field-assembled grounding electrodes are preferred because of their superior performance, ease of use,
and durability. Code users are reminded to observe bonding requirements for all non-current-carrying
parts of electrical equipment, raceways, or enclosures to ensure they are correctly bonded to the
service equipment or system grounding conductor. The requirements of Rule 58-600 are not intended to
be used for bonding purposes.

Section 60
Rule 60-000
Communication circuits are designed primarily to carry information or signals in the form of audio,
video, or data and may also transmit signals for supervision and control. Generally these circuits
operate within the line-to-ground current and voltage limitations established for Class 2 circuits as
described in Rule 16-200.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 658



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 60-104
A communication building entrance cable is deemed to be the cable that enters into a building to
provide the main incoming communication circuits from other external buildings, telephone central
offices, or similar locations, and that terminates at the point of building entrance (see the Note to
Rule 60-700 for point of entrance).
Rule 60-200 2)
The point at which the exposed conductors enter a building is considered to be the point of emergence
through an exterior wall, through a concrete floor slab, or from a totally enclosed non-combustible
entrance raceway.
Rule 60-204
These circuits are subject to high ground potential rises and/or electromagnetic induction from faults of
high-voltage power lines terminating at the power station. This could cause extraneous cable stresses
and transfer of ground potential rises and propagation of hazardous electrical surges to equipment or
personnel. ANSI/IEEE 487 should be used as the reference in providing protection for communication
circuits in high-voltage stations.
Rule 60-402
Connecting blocks of a non-protective type are deemed to be those that provide for an electrical
connection only and that do not provide protection as required by Rules 60-200 and 60-202.
Rule 60-700
The point of cable entry into a building is considered to be the point of emergence through an exterior
wall, through a concrete floor slab, or from a totally enclosed non-combustible entrance raceway.
Rule 60-702
It is the intent of this Rule that where a conductor is installed to exclusively bond to ground the
entrance cable sheath, the maximum required size is No. 6 AWG copper. However, where the conductor
will also function as a common bonding conductor for other equipment, a larger gauge size may be
required.
Rule 60-704 c)
The wave front of a lightning surge has a rise time in the order of microseconds and is approximated by
equivalent frequencies between 25 and 250 kHz. As a result, the self-impedance of the grounding
conductor to the wave front of a lightning surge is very significant. For this reason it is paramount to
keep the length of the grounding conductor as short as practicable to guarantee the effectiveness of the
protector. As a guideline, it is suggested that the length of the grounding conductor be limited to 6 m
maximum.
Rule 60-706
It is intended that the grounding electrode for power circuits be the common point of any multi-
bonding with other grounding electrodes.

Section 62
Rule 62-000
Space heating
Space heating is the application of any fixed heater technology that results in adding heat to an
enclosed space or room. This is normally for increasing the comfort of persons or animals but could
include storage spaces or rooms where it is important to keep stored material above a certain
temperature. Some examples of space heating are
a) central heating units;
b) baseboard heaters;
c) radiant heaters;
d) wall and ceiling heaters; and

e) floor warming heaters (the primary purpose of a floor warming heater may be for comfort of
persons walking on the floor, but such heaters also add heat to the room)

Note: Many heater technologies add heat to a room by convection, conduction, and radiation.

Surface heating
Surface heating is the application of fixed heater technology that results in increasing the temperature
of a surface. Some examples of surface heating are
a) pipe heating;
b) storage tank or vessel heating; and
c) snow and/or ice melting on or embedded in a surface, such as on roofs and gutters or embedded

in concrete, asphalt or soil, and similar applications.

Other heating systems
Other heating systems are applications of fixed heaters that are not space or surface heating systems.
Some examples of these systems are
a) pipe internal heaters, often referred to as “gut” heating;
b) immersion heaters; and
c) hot water tanks.
Rule 62-102
The term “heating cable” is being replaced in product Standards and International Standards (CSA, IEEE,
IEC) with “trace heater”.

Dielectric heating
The operating principle behind dielectric heating is that when an insulating material is placed within a
high-frequency electrical field, molecules are excited by the alternating electric field, causing heating
within the material. The frequency applied is generally between 1 and 300 MHz, and depends on the
material to be heated. This is sometimes called capacitive or radio frequency (RF) heating.

Impedance heating
The operating principle behind impedance heating is that an applied ac voltage on an electrically
conductive object to be heated will generate a current in that object, resulting in direct Joule (I2R,
sometimes called resistive or ohmic) heating within the object itself. There is also some additional heat
generated due to impedance effects of eddy currents and hysteresis losses.
Note: Impedance heating was called pipeline resistance heating in previous editions of this Code.

Δ Induction heating
The operating principle behind induction heating is that coiled conductors surrounding an electrically
conductive object or running parallel to it create magnetic-flux-induced currents in that object resulting
in direct Joule (I2R, sometimes called resistive or ohmic) heating of the object itself. Eddy currents and
hysteresis losses will add to the heat generated. Induction heating is generally applied at line
frequencies for surface heating of pipelines and vessels (see Rule 62-300), and at higher frequencies for
heating objects and materials, e.g., in aluminum smelting or induction welding (see Rules 62-400
to 62-408).

Δ Skin effect trace heating
The operating principle behind skin effect trace heating is that an applied ac voltage will generate a
current in an insulated conductor that returns along the inner skin of a surrounding ferromagnetic
envelope (heat tube). The concentration of the return current on the inner surface of the heat tube is
due to the magnetic field associated with the current flow through the inner insulated conductor. This
has the effect of increasing the electrical resistance of the heat tube, thereby creating direct Joule (I2R,
sometimes called resistive or ohmic) heating.

Rules 62-102 and 62-116
For fixed infrared radiant heaters of the metal-sheath glowing element type, CSA C22.2 No. 46 requires
that a specific marking be used. Clause 6.1.24 of CSA C22.2 No. 46 reads as follows:

When permanently connected radiant-type heaters employ a metal-sheathed heater element, and
the visible portion of the element attains a temperature of at least 650 °C under normal operating
conditions, the heaters shall be permanently marked with the following or equivalent:

Δ Rule 62-104
Manufacturers’ instructions are incorporated into the Canadian Electrical Code, Part II certification
process for heating equipment and form an important part of the overall safety of the final installation.

A mineral-insulated trace heater can be of similar construction as a mineral-insulated power cable, but
is not considered a power cable. A trace heater is electrical equipment. Consequently, the sheath is not
serving as a bonding conductor, but rather as the conductive enclosure part of the electrical equipment.
This conductive enclosure is connected to a bonding conductor at the point where it receives its supply.

The design of trace heater installations often includes taps to extend a section of trace heater in one or
more directions. The tap connections can be made using properly designed cable connectors or by using
connections made within conductive or nonconductive enclosures, ensuring that the continuity of the
trace heater conductive sheath is maintained.

When the connections are made in conductive enclosures, the continuity of the trace heater conductive
sheath is maintained by their attachment to the conductive enclosure itself. Conductive cable glands
and the conductive enclosure containing the tap connections are considered an extension of the
mineral-insulated electrical trace heater sheath and, therefore, an extension of the conductive
enclosure part of the electrical equipment.
Rule 62-106
The purpose of this Rule is to ensure that heating devices are marked for the environment for which
they are installed. Wet conditions include areas where heating devices are installed in concrete slabs or
other masonry in direct contact with moist earth, or in slabs complete with drains such as showers,
where measures to isolate the area from moisture have not been installed. Concrete floors exposed to
periodic hosing down or rain (such as might occur at loading docks) should be considered wet locations.
Rule 62-108 4)
Where a tap conductor is installed to ensure that the conductor terminating to a heating device set
meets the conductor temperature rating specified by the manufacturer, the tap conductor needs to be
of a sufficient length to dissipate the heat generated by the heating device.
Rule 62-114
See the Note to Rules 8-104, 8-304, and 62-114.

Δ Rule 62-116 1)
The intent of the “ground fault setting sufficient to allow normal operation of the heater” is that the
setting should be as low as practical to allow start-up and running of the heater without nuisance trips,
yet still providing ground fault protection for the equipment and insulated supply conductors. For many
systems, this would be a fixed trip 30 mA ground fault protection device. For higher leakage current
circuits, the trip level for adjustable devices is typically set at 30 mA above any inherent capacitive
leakage current. If a fixed trip ground fault protection device is to be used, it should be selected to meet
this intent.

Δ Rule 62-126
Splicing, repair, modification, or assembly of series trace heaters in the field should be done only by
trained personnel. Owners are responsible for ensuring that persons undertaking work outlined in this
Rule are properly qualified and trained by the manufacturer. Training would normally cover fault
finding, repairing, tagging, and reporting.

Δ Rule 62-126 2) c)
This Item recognizes the ability of a qualified person to perform design modifications using the
manufacturer’s design tools. This would normally be an engineering professional or other person
permitted to practice engineering.

Changes to the size, length, or number of non-heating leads would be considered a modification to the
trace heater.

For field-assembled trace heaters, the tag supplied by the manufacturer indicates that the product,
including connection kits and accessories, is certified.

For modified trace heaters, the manufacturer-supplied tag provides traceability to the certified trace
heater system. This tag is to be installed in addition to the original tag.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Δ Rule 62-204
Trace heaters embedded in concrete or in plaster attached to the concrete have about the same effect
on temperatures within the concrete; therefore, Subrule 2) applies in either case.

Δ Rule 62-208 3)
CSA C22.2 No. 130 allows for some heating devices that do not have conductive coverings, braids,
sheaths, or shields.
Rule 62-212
See the Note to Rules 62-200 2) and 62-212.
Rule 62-216 1)
The 13 mm clearance is to prevent mechanical damage of the heating device during installation of the
gypsum board and other cementitious material.
Rule 62-222
Sauna heaters should be secured in place to ensure that the minimum clearances specified on the
nameplate are not reduced. If the heater is provided with legs, they should not be removed in favour of
other supports. Covering combustible surfaces with non-combustible material, such as metal tile or
asbestos board, does not ensure safety from fire.

Sauna heaters marked “FOR INSTALLATION ON CONCRETE FLOORS ONLY” should not be installed on
combustible floors, even if the floor is covered with ceramic tile, asbestos board, or other
non-combustible material.

Equipment or material of other than an electrical nature should not be installed or placed in proximity
to electrical equipment or in a manner that may create a dangerous condition. Benches, shelves,
guardrails, and other structures or obstructions should not be placed closer to the heating unit than is
permitted for the clearances specified on the nameplate.

To properly control the maximum temperature in the room, the heat sensor for the temperature
control should be located near the heater. A timer should be installed to turn off the heater after a
predetermined or preset time.
Rule 62-300
Some surface heating devices may be used in space heating applications. For example, CSA C22.2
No. 130, which covers surface heating devices, recognizes that some surface heaters may be used for
space heating.

Δ Rule 62-304
For the purposes of Item a), mechanical protection of the trace heater that exits the medium may
include metallic or non-metallic conduit. It is recommended that trace heaters and heating panels
installed outdoors under the surface of driveways, sidewalks, and similar locations
a) not have spacing between adjacent trace heater runs less than 25 mm on centres;
b) be installed so that adjacent runs of trace heater are spaced between 25 mm and 200 mm apart to

provide for even heating;
c) be secured in place by frames, spreaders, or other means while being embedded or covered, to

prevent damage to the trace heaters;
d) be installed on an appropriate substrate to support maximum load without crumbling, settling, or

extensive movement to prevent cracking or breaking of the trace heater or panel; and
e) not be installed where they cross expansion joints unless provision is made for expansion and

contraction.

It is recommended that when trace heaters are embedded in asphalt, they be rated at not more than
82 W/m to prevent softening or warping of the asphalt and, where no curbs are provided, that they be
installed 300 mm or more from the edge of the driveway.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Δ Rule 62-314
This Rule covers skin effect trace heating system technology, which is typically used for pipe, vessel,
equipment, and structure heating. Skin effect trace heating is a special form of heating in which a single
insulated conductor is run inside a ferromagnetic envelope (heat tube or enclosure).

Because the insulated conductor is part of a certified system, it does not need to meet the
requirements of Table 19 or the ampacity requirements of Rule 4-004.

The insulated skin effect conductor is connected to the envelope at one end (the far end) and a source
of ac power is connected between the insulated skin effect conductor and the envelope at the other
end (the supply end). Current flows from the power source through the insulated skin effect conductor
to the far end and returns through the envelope. Figure B62-6 illustrates the basic system.

3) The optional power/transition

In skin effect trace heating, heat is generated in the ferromagnetic envelope (or heat tube) wall by the
I2R loss of the return current flow in the envelope (heat tube) and by hysteresis and eddy currents
induced by the alternating magnetic field around the insulated conductor. Additional heat is produced
by the I2R loss in the insulated conductor.

The inductive interaction between the current in the insulated skin effect conductor and the return
current in the envelope (heat tube) causes the current in the envelope (heat tube) to concentrate at its
inner surface (skin).

Maximum current limitations for insulated skin effect conductors are based on the insulated skin effect
conductor operating temperature calculated values established by the manufacturer and usually
verified by a third-party certification body.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

All components should be properly protected from corrosion with coatings or materials suitable for the
location. Skin effect trace heating systems include overcurrent devices upstream and downstream of the
supply transformer. In addition, trace heating system current monitoring is recommended.

In Rule 62-314 1) b), the exterior surface of the ferromagnetic envelope does not see any ac voltage
from the skin effect circuit due to the magnetic interaction between the insulated skin effect conductor
and the ferromagnetic envelope. However, grounding of the envelope is an additional safety measure to
ensure that, under all fault conditions, there will be no shock voltage imparted on the protected
equipment. If the protected equipment, such as a pipeline, is buried in the ground, it may be protected
by a cathodic protection system. In this case, the cathodic protection system design should take into
consideration the presence of an ac ground on the skin effect system.

In Subrule 2), the reference is made to IEEE 844.2/CSA C293.2, which is the application guide for design,
equipment selection, and installation. IEEE 844.1/CSA C22.2 No. 293.1 is the Part II certification
standard, providing construction and performance requirements for skin effect trace heating systems.
These systems are custom engineered for each application, needing the combination of design,
equipment selection, system certification, installation and operating information, to enable initial safe
initial installation and long term operations. This is provided by the use of the certification standard and
the companion application guide.

Δ Rule 62-316
This Rule applies to impedance heating system technology. Impedance heating is a special form of
heating in which an alternating current is passed directly through the object to be heated in order to
raise its temperature. See Figure B62-7.

Impedance heating systems should be properly designed, installed, and maintained in order to ensure
safe operation. These systems are normally supplied with sufficient documentation to ensure safe
installation and operation throughout the system’s working life.

operating information to enable safe initial installation, start-up, and operation. This is provided by the
use of the certification Standard in conjunction with the companion application Standard.

There are three basic configurations for impedance heating systems, and they are shown in

The use of renewable energy systems as stand-alone or interactive power supply systems has steadily
increased as the technology and availability of renewable energy equipment have evolved. Section 64
covers stand-alone and interactive renewable energy systems.

The rising demand for electrical power has led to the development of power sources that are viable
alternatives to or can be interconnected with electric utility distribution systems.

For additional information, see CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 257.

Small stationary power systems, with less than 10 kW net electrical output, are intended for power
supply or combined heat and power production primarily for residential applications, such as single
homes or clusters of homes, and commercial occupancies, such as small stores, warehouses, small and
medium enterprises, and small and medium industry. Small stationary power plants are equipped with a
control system enabling at least fully automatic and unattended emergency shutdown. Fully automatic
operation, including regular start-up and shutdown procedures, are not required.

Medium-sized stationary power systems, operating from 10 kW up to 500 kW net electrical output, are
intended for power supply or combined heat and power production in the medium power range.
Typical applications are big office buildings, supermarkets, cold stores, and industrial and municipal

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

applications and installations for decentralized combined heat and power production. Medium-sized
stationary power systems are usually equipped with a fully automated control system, including start-
up, shutdown, and emergency shutdown procedures.

Large stationary power systems, operating at more than 500 kW net electrical output, are intended for
power supply or combined heat and power production primarily for industrial, municipal, and
commercial applications. Large stationary power systems should be operated by a master control unit
that uses electrical and/or thermal requirements from a grid or stand-alone distribution network for
control purposes and that can be superseded by safeguard personnel. These safeguard personnel
should be trained to react to hazards and be prepared to interact with the automatic control system.
Rule 64-002
Figures B64-3 to B64-5 illustrate typical solar photovoltaic systems, showing the various terms and
circuits referenced.

Different inverters may require different photovoltaic array and wiring configurations. These
configurations may be divided into two groups:
a) a floating array (as shown in the illustration of an interconnected system in Figure B64-4) that

requires a 2-pole disconnect switch; and
b) a grounded array that requires a single-pole disconnect switch, except for a 3-wire neutral-

grounded array that requires a 2-pole disconnect switch to interrupt both ungrounded conductors.

Δ Battery
Additional information regarding the assembly of cells forming batteries is located in UL 1973.

Δ Energy storage system
Additional information regarding energy storage systems is located in UL 9540. The Standard does not
include other storage systems, such as an uninterruptible power system (UPS) which is covered by
CSA C22.2 No. 107.3.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 680



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

CSA C22.2 No. 107.3 defines an uninterruptible power system as follows:

Uninterruptible power system (UPS) — combination of converters, switches, and energy storage
devices (such as batteries), constituting a power system for maintaining continuity of power to a
load in case of input power failure.

Δ Field-assembled energy storage systems
Field-assembled energy storage systems are not approved to UL 9540. These systems involve
interconnection of separate components forming an energy storage system.

Fuel cell systems
Fuel cell systems generate dc electrical current through a chemical reaction in which fuel such as natural
gas or liquefied petroleum gas is consumed. In contrast to internal combustion prime movers, the fuel
gas is consumed through an electrochemical process rather than a combustion process. A power
inverter converts the direct current to alternating current. The installation requirements of Section 64
allow power derived from fuel cells to be safely delivered into residential and light commercial
occupancies, either as the sole source of electrical power or as a source integrated with a utility or
other power source.

Full load rating
This is the maximum power that the hydraulic turbine is able to generate at design head and flow.

Δ Functionally-grounded photovoltaic system
A functionally-grounded photovoltaic system is often connected to ground through a fuse, circuit
breaker, resistance device, non-isolated grounded ac circuit, or electronic means that is part of a
ground-fault protection system. Conductors in these systems that are normally at ground potential may
have voltage-to-ground during fault conditions.

Hydrokinetic power system
Hydrokinetic power systems include river energy converters and tidal energy converters.

Inverter
Inverters that are connected to the grid may incorporate a power conditioning unit (PCU) that improves
power quality in order to deliver voltage at a proper level and with proper characteristics. Users of this
Code should refer to CSA C22.2 No. 107.1, Clause 14, which provides additional information on the
requirements for interactive inverters.

Micro-hydropower systems
Micro-hydropower systems convert the potential energy in flowing and falling water into electricity by
means of a waterwheel or hydraulic turbine. A typical system has the following components: a water
intake or weir, canal, forebay tank, penstock, and powerhouse and tailrace.

Photovoltaic combiner
This is a general term that applies to both photovoltaic combiners and photovoltaic recombiners. It is
used where there is no need to make a distinction between the two.

Photovoltaic recombiner
This term is specific to photovoltaic recombiners and is used where the requirements for a photovoltaic
recombiner differ from those for a photovoltaic combiner.

Point of common coupling

Renewable energy systems
Renewable energy systems may be stand-alone or interactive with other electrical power production

Δ Self-contained energy storage systems
Self-contained energy storage systems are approved to UL 9540. These systems may involve populating
and interconnection of batteries and associated equipment at the final installation site.
Rule 64-052
For the purpose of this Rule, multiple inverters and associated components connected to the same
renewable energy source are considered as one power generation source, and associated wiring may be
contained in the same raceway.

Δ Rules 64-058 3) and 64-912
DC fault currents are considerably harder to interrupt than ac faults. Overcurrent devices marked only
for ac use should not be used in dc circuits. Equipment acceptable in dc systems, such as automotive,
marine, and telecommunications applications, is not suitable for use in permanent renewable energy
systems meeting the requirements of this Code.
Rule 64-058 4)
Circuit breakers that are marked “Line” and “Load” have been evaluated for connection only in the
direction marked. Circuit breakers without “Line” and “Load” have been evaluated for connection in
both directions.
Rule 64-060
Because photovoltaic modules are energized while exposed to light, the installation, replacement, or
servicing of array components while the photovoltaic modules are irradiated may expose persons to the
hazard of electric shock.

It is intended that means will be provided to isolate and disable portions of an array or photovoltaic
module that may require servicing. An opaque covering is an acceptable means of disabling the array.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 64-060 8)
The required disconnecting means is to ensure complete isolation when fuses that could be energized
from both sides are being removed.
Rule 64-060 10)
It is intended by this Subrule that the following or equivalent wording should be provided on or
adjacent to the disconnecting means:

WARNING: ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARD. DO NOT TOUCH TERMINALS. TERMINALS ON BOTH THE LINE AND
LOAD SIDES MAY BE ENERGIZED IN THE OPEN POSITION.

See Appendix M for a French translation of this marking.
Rule 64-060 12)
The intent of this Subrule is to have a disconnecting means for the output circuit of a photovoltaic
combiner capable of making and interrupting its full load rating and that may be opened with safety to
the operator with a fault on the system.

Δ Rule 64-064
Inverters used in renewable energy power systems usually contain a transformer that isolates the dc
grounded circuit conductor from the ac grounded circuit conductor. This isolation necessitates that both
a dc and ac grounding system be installed. The two grounding systems are bonded together or have a
common grounding electrode so that all ac and dc grounded circuit conductors and equipment have the
same near-zero potential to earth. The interconnected battery cells are considered grounded where
energy storage and renewable energy systems are installed in accordance with this Rule.
Rule 64-064 5)
A renewable energy dc supply system equipped with a ground fault protection device is permitted to
have the required grounded conductor connected to the ground via the ground fault protection device.
Where this connection is internal to the ground fault equipment, it is not duplicated by an external
connection.
Rule 64-066 1) b)
It is intended by this Item that the following or equivalent wording should be provided on or adjacent to
the disconnecting means:

WARNING: ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARD. THE CONDUCTORS OF THIS RENEWABLE ENERGY POWER SYSTEM
ARE UNGROUNDED AND MAY BE ENERGIZED.

See Appendix M for a French translation of this marking.
Rule 64-066 1) d) ii)
In an ungrounded dc system, a single ground fault will cause current to flow if there is another
connection to ground in the system and if there is no isolation between the grounding point and the
ground fault. For example, fault current will flow in a system in which a non-isolated inverter is
connected to a grounded ac system with a ground fault on the dc supply circuit.
Rules 64-068 and 64-070

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 64-076
For the type of connection described in this Rule, the switching equipment ensures isolation because
the system is a non-grid-interactive renewable energy system and does not export any power to the
supply system.
Rule 64-078 2)
To ensure system stability of the grid and the restoration of normal voltage and frequency, the supply
authority may specify a delay period.
Rule 64-100
Both stand-alone and interactive inverters are power-limited devices. Output circuits connected to
these devices are sized on the continuous rated outputs of these devices and are not based on load
calculations or battery banks, if any. Some inverters may have specifications listing sustained maximum
output currents, and the higher of this number or the rated output should be used.
Rule 64-102 a)
A stand-alone residential or commercial renewable energy installation may have an ac output and be
connected to a building electrical system in compliance with all the Rules of this Code. Even though
such an installation may have service entrance equipment rated at 100 or 200 A at 120/240 V, there is
no requirement that the renewable energy source provide either the rated full current or the dual
voltages of the service equipment. While safety requirements mandate full compliance with this Code, a
renewable energy installation is usually designed so that the actual ac demands on the system are sized
to the output rating of the renewable energy system.
Rule 64-102 c) ii)
Multi-wire branch circuits are common in one- and two-family dwelling units. When these multi-wire
branch circuits are connected to a normal 120/240 V ac service, the currents in the neutral conductors
of the circuits (typically Nos. 14 to 3 AWG) subtract or are, at most, no larger than the rating of the
branch circuit overcurrent device. When these electrical systems are connected to a single 120 V
renewable energy power system inverter by paralleling the two ungrounded conductors in the service
entrance load centre, the currents in the neutral conductor for each multi-wire branch circuit add rather
than subtract. The currents in the neutral conductors may be as high as twice the rating of the branch
circuit overcurrent device. With this configuration, neutral conductor overloading is possible.
Rule 64-102 c) iv)
It is intended by this Item that the following or equivalent wording should be provided on or adjacent to
the disconnecting means:

WARNING: SINGLE 120 V SUPPLY. DO NOT CONNECT MULTI-WIRE BRANCH CIRCUITS.

See Appendix M for a French translation of this marking.
Rule 64-106
An inverter or an ac module in an interactive renewable energy system should automatically
de-energize its output to the connected electrical production and distribution network upon loss of
voltage in that system and should remain in that state until the electrical production and distribution
network voltage has been restored. A renewable energy system that is normally interactive may be
permitted to operate as a stand-alone system to supply loads that have been disconnected from an
electrical production and distribution network source.

Marking requirements for interactive inverters are given in CSA C22.2 No. 107.1 and CAN/CSA-C22.2
No. 62109.
Rule 64-110
Supply authority standards typically specify voltage balance requirements. The voltage unbalance limit
usually allowed in accordance with supply authority requirements is approximately 2 to 3%. For
interactive single-phase inverters, unbalanced voltages can be minimized by the same methods that are
used for single-phase loads on a three-phase power system. See ANSI/C84.1-2011.

See Appendix M for a French translation of this marking.
Δ Rule 64-112 4) e)

This Item recognizes equipment installed to limit the current on the busbar or conductor to prevent
overloading. Consideration should be given to ensure that in the event of equipment failure, the busbar
or conductor will not become overloaded.

An energy storage system is a load when charging and a source when discharging.
Rule 64-112 5)
Load side connection of energy sources to commonly available ac ground fault circuit interrupters and
ac equipment ground fault protection circuit breakers may result in back-feed currents from the
renewable energy system output. Tests have shown that back-feed currents through these devices may
damage them and prevent operation.
Rules 64-200 and 64-218
When a reflecting system is used for irradiance enhancement, increased levels of output power may
result. Marking of equipment should indicate the increased levels when such equipment is used.

Rule 64-202 1)
The 125% factor specified by Rule 64-202 is the temperature adjustment factor. The rating of
photovoltaic modules is based on the standard test conditions (an irradiance of 1000 W/m2 and an
ambient temperature of 25 °C). The voltage produced by the module increases as the temperature
decreases. The 125% factor is based on a minimum module temperature of –40 °C.
Rule 64-202 2)
The lowest daily minimum temperature described in this Subrule is available from Environment and
Climate Change Canada, “Canadian Climate Normals”. Using the manufacturer’s temperature
coefficient, the maximum photovoltaic source circuit and output circuit voltage may be calculated using
the following formula:

VMPC = VOC × [1 + (TM – 25) × TK]
where
TMI =I lowest daily minimum temperature in degrees Celsius
TKI =I temperature coefficient in per cent per degree Celsius
VOCI =I rated open-circuit voltage of the photovoltaic power source in volts
VMPCI =I maximum photovoltaic source circuit and output circuit voltage in volts

Example:

A solar photovoltaic system is installed in a geographic location where the lowest daily minimum
temperature (TM) is –18 °C. According to the manufacturer’s data, the temperature coefficient (TK)
is –0.25%/°C and the rated open-circuit voltage (VOC) is 92 V.

VMPC = 92 V × {1 + [(–18 °C – 25 °C) × –0.25%/°C]}

VMPC = 92 V × [1 + (– 43 × –0.0025)]

VMPC = 92 V × 1.1075

VMPC = 101.89 V
Δ Rule 64-202 5) c)

“DANGER 1500 V dc” (see Appendix M for a French translation of this marking) is an example of the
marking required by this Subrule for a system operating at a 1500 V dc maximum photovoltaic circuit
voltage.

Photovoltaic source and output circuits and equipment connected to or within those circuits are
considered inaccessible where they are located within a fenced enclosure in accordance with
Rule 26-300, guarded by locked doors, elevated 3 m or more above grade level or above any surface
that a person can stand on, or where access is restricted by other effective means.
Rule 64-208
For the application of this Rule, photovoltaic modules are considered inaccessible to the public where
they are located within a fenced enclosure in accordance with Rule 26-300, guarded by locked doors,
elevated 3 m or more above grade level or above any surface that a person can stand on, or where
access is restricted by other effective means.

For the application of this Rule, modules without an application class marking are considered to be
application Class A.
Rule 64-210
Most photovoltaic modules do not have provision for attaching raceways. These circuits may have to be
made not readily accessible by physical barriers such as metal screening, elevation, or fencing.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Photovoltaic modules operate at elevated temperatures when exposed to high ambient temperatures
and to bright sunlight. These temperatures may routinely exceed 70 °C in many locations. Module
interconnection insulated conductors and cables are available with insulation rated for wet locations
and a temperature rating of 90 °C or greater.
Rule 64-210 4)
The intent of this Subrule is to protect solar photovoltaic cable from mechanical damage, including
rubbing on surfaces such as roofing and array structures.
Rule 64-210 5)
The intent of this Subrule is to provide protection against damage from rodents by enclosing the
photovoltaic source circuit insulated conductors and cables in material such as expanded metal, solid
metal, and screening.
Rule 64-210 8)
Type RPVU cable with FT1 markings is suitable for installation on buildings.
Rule 64-212
CSA C22.2 No. 271 requires the positive or negative identification on RPV or RPVU multi-conductor
cables to be “+/-”, “pos/neg”, or “positive/negative”. Single-conductor cables are permitted to be
marked in the same manner.
Rule 64-214 1)
Where there is no back-feed from a battery or inverter, the maximum short-circuit current that can flow
in any of the photovoltaic source circuits is the sum of the short-circuit current ratings of all the other
photovoltaic source circuits connected in parallel.

Example of a calculation where the short-circuit current ratings of all photovoltaic source circuits are
equal:

Maximum photovoltaic source circuit short-circuit current = (the sum of the short-circuit current for
all photovoltaic source circuits connected in parallel) minus (the short-circuit current for one of the
photovoltaic source circuits)

Rule 64-218
The requirements for a photovoltaic rapid shutdown system are given in CSA C22.2 No. 330.
Rule 64-218 3)
The intent of this Subrule is to limit photovoltaic source or output circuits to not more than 30 V within
30 s of rapid shutdown initiation, where the voltage and power are measured between any two
photovoltaic source or output circuit conductors, and between any photovoltaic source or output circuit
conductors and ground.
Rule 64-220
Photovoltaic connectors of the sleeve- and pin-type are approved for use as a mated pair only, i.e., the
connectors are certified as a pair.

Each connector manufacturer uses materials and procedures to manufacture their connectors in a
proprietary manner. Although the connectors may look electrically and mechanically compatible, there
is no evaluation to ensure that the production process of one manufacturer will result in its connectors
being compatible with another’s.
Rule 64-222
CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 61730-1 requires all conductive parts of a module that are accessible during normal
use to be bonded together and the method of bonding to be detailed in the installation manual. During
the approval process, all components, such as bonding clips, brackets, hardware, lugs, etc., used for
bonding are tested in accordance with CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 61730-2.

Rules 64-300 1) c), 64-400 1) c), 64-500 a), 64-600 a), and 64-700 1) c)
A brief system description typically includes a single-line diagram to identify components of the
interconnected system, including switching arrangements, interlocks, isolation points, and their relative
locations. See Figures B64-1 and B64-2 in the Note to Rule 64-000 for diagrams of interconnected
renewable energy systems.
Rule 64-300 2)
Some wind turbines rely on the connection from the alternator to a remote controller for speed
regulation. Opening turbine output circuit insulated conductors may cause mechanical damage to a
turbine and create excessive voltages that could damage equipment or expose persons to electric
shock.

Open-circuiting, short-circuiting, or mechanical brakes are used to disable a turbine for installation and
service.
Rule 64-302 3)
Wind turbines may use the electric grid to dump energy from short-term wind gusts. Normal operating
voltages are defined in CSA C235.
Rule 64-308 3)
Possible back-feed of current from any source of supply, including a supply through an inverter to the
wind turbine output circuit, is a consideration in determining whether adequate overcurrent protection
from all sources is provided. Some small wind systems rely on the turbine output circuit to regulate
turbine speed. Inverters may also operate in reverse for turbine start-up or speed control. In systems of
these types, the manufacturer’s instructions should be followed.
Rule 64-310 1)
The disconnecting means need not be suitable for use as service equipment unless used as service
entrance equipment.
Rule 64-310 5)
It is intended by this Subrule that the following or equivalent wording should be provided on or
adjacent to the disconnecting means:

WIND TURBINE GENERATOR SYSTEM DISCONNECT SWITCH.
Rule 64-312 1)
Attached metal parts, such as turbine blades and tails, that have no source of electrical energization
need not be grounded.
Rule 64-312 3)
Guy wires supporting towers that are adequately grounded are not likely to become energized and are
therefore not subject to the requirements of Section 10. Grounding of metallic guy wires may be
required by lightning codes.
Rule 64-316
Refer to CSA B72 and CAN/CSA-IEC 61400-24.
Rule 64-318
A small wind system employing a diversion load controller as the primary means of regulating the speed
of a wind turbine rotor is equipped with an additional, independent means to prevent overspeed
operation.
Rule 64-320
Some small wind turbines are equipped with integral surge devices.
Rule 64-400 2)
CSA C22.2 No. 272 requires the working space in wind turbines to meet the requirements of Rules 2-308
and 2-310. The Standard permits the working space to be reduced when electrical shock and arc flash

information is field assessed and recorded on the information labels supplied and installed by the
manufacturer.
Rule 64-404
In larger interconnected installations, additional devices are sometimes necessary to ensure stability
and the adequacy of the electrical equipment protection. For example, ferroresonance can produce
very high voltages in transformers with a wye-delta connection, requiring a surge arrester or high-speed
overvoltage relay or both. Other types of protection (e.g., loss of excitation protection and over-
excitation protection) are sometimes required to ensure the stability of the supply authority system in
the interests of public safety and equipment protection. This Rule requires that interconnected
installations be properly protected so that system stability is ensured and the electrical equipment
operates safely. The protection depends on the size and type of the interconnected generation
equipment.
Rule 64-406
In a consumer-owned interconnected power generation system, multiple sources can feed into a system
fault or feed a portion of the supply authority system. If a disconnecting means is opened for some
reason (e.g., as a result of a temporary fault or during a maintenance procedure) and isolates a portion
of the supply authority system, the interconnected electric power generation system can continue to
feed the load to the open disconnecting means, endangering personnel who expect the line to be
de-energized when the disconnecting means is open. If the supply authority disconnection means is
closed while the isolated section is still energized, the system will likely be out of phase. This can cause
severe damage to the wind turbine generator and other electrical equipment.

After the clearance of a fault, the supply authority equipment sometimes recloses automatically to
avoid a long interruption due to a temporary fault. When the supply authority equipment recloses, the
interconnected source must be out of service. Protection of the interconnected wind turbine generator
must be in effect before this automatic reclosing, and the automatic reclosing time must be long
enough to allow the interconnected source to be disconnected from the supply authority system. Since
there is often more than one automatic reclosing, it is important to wait until the normal voltage of the
supply authority is restored before reconnecting the interconnected source.

The requirements for the separation of the interconnected wind turbine generators from the supply
authority system depend on the type and size of the interconnected source. For example, line-
commutated inverters and induction generators are not usually capable of supplying load in isolation
from the power system because they need the supply authority voltage to operate. In the case of self-
commutated inverters and synchronous generation, under- or over-voltage relays, under- or over-
frequency relays, or more sophisticated protection may be required, depending on the size of the
interconnected source.
Rule 64-406 1)
The disconnecting means need not be suitable for use as service equipment unless the grounded circuit
conductor is grounded at the switch. The disconnecting means may be located either outside at the
base of the tower or inside the tower as close as practicable to where the supply insulated conductors
or cables enter.

Δ Rule 64-406 2) and 3)
See the Note to Rules 8-104, 8-304, and 62-114.

CSA C22.2 No. 272 defines a large wind turbine as a wind turbine of sufficient size that allows a person
to enter the turbine tower or nacelle.
Rule 64-406 6)
It is intended by this Subrule that the following or equivalent wording be provided on or adjacent to the
disconnecting means:

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 64-412
When installing lightning protection systems, installers should refer to the manufacturer’s
recommendations or applicable Standards (e.g., CSA B72, CAN/CSA-IEC 61400-24).
Rule 64-500
See also IEEE 1020 and Natural Resources Canada’s Micro-Hydropower Systems: A Buyer’s Guide.
Rule 64-502 a)
The rating of the generator is normally oversized to meet other electrical and mechanical safety
requirements; therefore, the nameplate rating of the generator does not necessarily represent the full
load current of the system. The capacity of the hydraulic turbine to generate power should be taken
into account when sizing the insulated supply conductors or cables.
Rule 64-508
It is intended by this Rule that the following or equivalent wording should be provided on or adjacent to
the disconnecting means:

MICRO-HYDROPOWER SYSTEM GENERATOR DISCONNECT SWITCH.
Rule 64-510 1)
The rating of the electronic governor may vary if it is used in combination with a mechanical governor.
Rules 64-510 3) and 64-604 3)
In order to compensate for non-sinusoidal current or harmonics generated as a result of power
electronic switching, the neutral conductor must be rated at the same ampacity as the phase supply
conductors.
Rule 64-602 4)
For general, stand-alone, or grid-tie systems, the conductors between the electric generator and the
input of the power conditioning unit may be permitted a voltage drop as high as 10%.
Rule 64-610
It is intended by this Rule that the following or equivalent wording should be provided on or adjacent to
the disconnecting means:

HYDROKINETIC POWER SYSTEM GENERATOR DISCONNECT SWITCH.
Rule 64-700 3)
It is intended by this Subrule that the following or equivalent wording be provided on or adjacent to the
disconnecting means:

WARNING: THIS DISCONNECTING MEANS DOES NOT CONTROL THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY STORAGE
DEVICES.

See Appendix M for a French translation of this marking.
Rule 64-706
It is intended by this Rule that the following or equivalent wording be provided on or adjacent to the
disconnecting means:

STATIONARY FUEL CELL SYSTEM DISCONNECT SWITCH.
Rule 64-710
Fuel cells should be considered fuel-burning equipment and be installed in accordance with the
National Building Code of Canada. Hydrogen-fuelled systems should be installed in accordance with
CAN/BNQ 1784-000.
Rule 64-716 2)
Ventilation systems should be designed to provide a negative or neutral pressure, with respect to the
building, in the room where the fuel cell power system is located.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 64-716 3)
Typically, hydrogen is not odorized.

Δ Rule 64-800
The intent of this Rule is to provide direction to Code users when components, such as batteries,
inverters, converters, and controls, are interconnected in the field to create an energy storage system
and have not been evaluated together as an assembly in accordance with UL 9540.

Δ Rule 64-802
Sufficient ventilation should be provided to prevent the hydrogen gas from building up to a level of 2%
by volume in the room air at any time.

When batteries are operated in constant-voltage-float service and the float voltage is maintained at
appropriate levels, generation of gas is very slight.

The rate of ventilation required to maintain the volume of hydrogen gas below the 2% level in a battery
room may be calculated in accordance with IEEE 484.

As an example, the volume of hydrogen gas generated daily by a 60 cell, 840 ampere-hour lead calcium
grid battery charging at 2.2 V per cell is determined as follows:

Total m3/min of hydrogen gas = number of cells × gas generation rate of battery type in m3/min × float
current in amperes × minutes/day.

For a room volume of 30 m3, the total volume of gas that should be allowed to accumulate in this room
is 30 m3 × 2% = 0.6 m3.

Therefore, to meet this 2% maximum level, one air change is required for each

However, a minimum of one to four air changes per hour in the battery room is recommended to
prevent pockets of hydrogen gas from accumulating and to ensure the comfort of the maintenance
personnel.

Δ Rule 64-802 2)
The freezing point of the electrolyte used in a lead-acid battery is –15 °C for a specific gravity of 1.150,
–20 °C for a specific gravity of 1.175, and –27 °C for a specific gravity of 1.200. The freezing point will be
higher if the battery is completely discharged. Therefore, batteries should not be located in areas where
the temperature is likely to fall below –7 °C.

Δ Rule 64-804
Metal trays and cases or containers in flooded, lead-acid battery systems operating over 50 V dc have
been shown to be a contributing factor in ground faults. Non-conductive racks, trays, and cases
minimize this problem.

Δ Rule 64-804 1)
The Standards for batteries are UL 1973 and UL 9540.

Δ Rule 64-804 4)
Batteries can be subject to extensive charge/discharge cycles and typically require frequent
maintenance (e.g., checking electrolyte, cleaning connections). At any voltage, a primary safety concern

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

in battery systems is that a fault (e.g., caused by a metal tool dropped onto a terminal) might result in a
fire or explosion. The best method for reducing this hazard is to ensure that battery systems are
guarded, as defined in Section 2.

Δ Rule 64-806
Large banks of storage batteries can deliver significant amounts of short-circuit current. As a result,
installers are reminded to ensure that the circuit overcurrent protective devices are selected and
coordinated so that the devices will clear a fault without extensively damaging the electrical
components of the circuit.

Δ Rule 64-812
Battery plates and terminals are frequently constructed of relatively soft lead and lead alloys encased in
plastics that are sealed with asphalt. Large-size, low-stranding stiff copper conductors attached to these
components can cause them to become distorted. The use of flexible cables reduces such distortions.
Examples of insulated conductors and cables with the appropriate physical and chemical-resistant
properties for use with lead-acid batteries are: R90, RW90, RWU90, RPV90, RPVU90, DLO, etc. These
insulated conductors and cables address the effects of dc currents and chemicals from lead-acid
batteries. This Code does not permit welding and battery cables to be used for this purpose since they
have no voltage rating.

Examples of fine strand conductors are Class G, H, M, I, and K

See the Note to Rules 12-406 4) and 64-812.
Δ Rule 64-818

Certain battery types, such as lithium-ion, valve-regulated lead-acid, or nickel-cadmium, can experience
thermal failure when overcharged.

Δ Rule 64-820
If any portion of a diversion charge control system fails, the batteries may be overcharged, creating a
potentially hazardous condition. A second, independent charge control method (usually a series
regulator) and robust diversion controller circuits minimize potential problems.

Δ Rule 64-820 3)
An interconnected utility system is not to be considered a reliable diversion load.

Δ Rule 64-900

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Δ Rule 64-916 3)
Energy storage systems are bi-directional, and fault current can be available from more than one
source. Energy storage system circuits connected in parallel can all contribute to a fault; therefore,
bonding conductors should be sized according to the largest overcurrent device in the circuit.

Δ Rule 64-918 1)
UL 9540 requires energy storage systems intended for dwelling units to be marked “Suitable for Use in
Residential Dwelling Units Where Permitted”.

Δ Rule 64-918 2)
Alternative locations may be considered, subject to discussions with the local building, fire, or
appropriate authority having jurisdiction.

Δ Rule 64-918 7)
See the Note to Rules 2-328 and 64-918 7).

Δ Rule 64-918 8)
UL 9540A defines a thermal runaway as “The incident when an electrochemical cell increases its
temperature through self-heating in an uncontrollable fashion. The thermal runaway progresses when
the cell’s generation of heat is at a higher rate than the heat it can dissipate. This may lead to fire,
explosion and gas evolution”.

Δ Rule 64-926 4)
UL 9540 requires charge controllers to be part of the self-contained energy storage systems.

The deck in the vicinity of the deck box may be sloped up to the top of the deck box from the normal
deck level.

If a deck box is located so that the top of the box is above the finished level of the pool deck, the box
should not be located in a walkway unless afforded additional protection such as by location under
diving boards, adjacent to fixed structures, or in similar areas.
Rule 68-062 3)
Audio isolation transformers should
a) have either the primary and secondary windings wound on separate bobbins on the core legs or a

grounded metal shield between the primary and secondary windings; and
b) withstand a 60 Hz test voltage of 2500 V applied between the primary and secondary windings for

a period of 1 min without breakdown.

Microphones used in the vicinity of pools and baptismal fonts must have audio isolation transformers
and cables with ungrounded conductors installed between them and any mixer, pre-amplifier, amplifier,
or like equipment.

Rule 68-404 4)
The intent of Subrule 4) is to provide protection against entrapment hazards associated with spas and
hot tubs located in any occupancy except a dwelling unit, by installing an emergency shut-off switch
within sight and 15 m of the spa or hot tub. It is also intended that such a switch be located at least 1 m
horizontally from the spa or hot tub, as specified in Subrule 1). It is intended by this requirement that an
emergency shut-off switch required to activate the audible and visual trouble-signal devices may be
assembled and interconnected with these devices in the field, and it may be provided by an inline-
operated device or a remote control circuit that causes the pump circuit to open.

Δ Rule 68-408

less than 300 mm above the tub rim is considered an acceptable means to prevent water from
contacting blower live parts.

Section 70
Rule 70-106
The conduit service facility that must be provided for the main communication entrance service into a
mobile home is usually located in the living room, main hallway, or kitchen area. An additional conduit
service facility should be provided wherever an extension communication outlet is to be installed, such
as in the master bedroom. If the conduit service facility is to be used for both telephone and cable
television services, the minimum conduit size should be 21 trade size inside diameter.
Rule 70-122 1)
In applying Rule 26-722 a) for this Subrule, it is not necessary to include in the linear measurements the
space occupied by standard door openings, closets, or cupboards that have been designed to render the
wall space unusable for electrical equipment.
Rule 70-122 4)
The intent of this Subrule is to ensure that receptacles that are mounted on the underside of trailers to
supply power to heating cable sets for freeze protection of plumbing pipes on trailers are provided with
ground fault protection and that they are properly identified for that use. Heating cable sets
(particularly the self-limiting type) without ground fault protection have caused numerous fires on
trailers.

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Section 72
Δ Rule 72-102 2)

The phrase “recreational vehicle park” is intended to refer to a place where recreational vehicles,
trailers, or tents have allotted spaces, which are referred to in this Subrule as recreational vehicle lot(s),
and which may or may not have a supply service at each lot.

It is intended that the watts used to calculate the load for the service or feeder supplying each
recreational vehicle lot be based on only one camping unit per receptacle or group of receptacles.

Δ Rule 72-102 2) e)
It is intended that individual recreational vehicle lot load calculations are based on the usage of only
one receptacle. Where there is more than one receptacle available and intended to be used at the same
time as a single recreational vehicle unit, those intended loads would be added to the basic site
calculation. Examples of such other loads may be for vehicle receptacles as described in Rule 8-400 or
8-500, heat tapes or underbelly heaters, other appliances or site lighting, electric vehicle charging loads,
etc.

Δ Rule 72-102 4)
Recreational vehicle lots used exclusively for tenting purposes generally do not have large loads;
therefore, a minimum of 600 W for each 5-15R or 5-20R receptacle is considered adequate. However,
this demand factor may be inadequate in areas with extended periods of extreme hot or cold with
loaded circuits for heating or air-conditioning loads.

When it is anticipated that the recreational vehicle lots used exclusively for tenting purposes supplied
by a 5-15R or 5-20R receptacle may supply heavier loads, such as electric heaters, then the receptacle
should be individually supplied by a dedicated branch circuit.
Rule 72-108
The 5-15R, 5-20R, and 14-50R receptacle configurations referred to in Subrules 1) a), 1) b), and 1) d) are
shown in Diagram 1.

Δ Rule 72-112
The recreational vehicle lot may be the back-in, drive-in, or pull-through type. The intent of Subrule 1) is
to specify the location of the lot supply equipment in order to harmonize with
CSA Z240.6.2/C22.2 No. 148 requirements for power supply point of entry. For pull-through lots
designed to accommodate vehicles towing boats or other trailers, the left edge (driver’s side of the
parked RV) of the stand should be marked in order to reduce the use of extension cords. See Figures
B72-1, B72-2, and B72-3.

Section 74
Rule 74-004 3)
Because there are many variables in the structural design of airport runways, taxiways, and aprons
depending on the required design strength of the surface material, and to ensure that the installation of
a conduit within the surface material will not result in damage to the runway, taxiway, or apron, this
Subrule intends that such an installation be designed by a civil engineer in accordance with good
engineering practice and that the design be acceptable to the airport authorities.

Section 78
Rule 78-050 2)
Receptacles resistant to condensing marine humidity are typically of industrial specification, constructed
using copper-rich metallic alloys for both electrical components and for mounting means, whether
nickel plated or not. Steel, plated or not, other than stainless steel, is usually not used. Receptacles
complying with the ASTM B117 500 h salt spray (fog) test with no visible corrosion are deemed to meet
the requirement.

To minimize deterioration due to marine environmental conditions, the following materials have been
found to be generally acceptable:
a) copper-free aluminum with aluminum or stainless steel hardware;
b) fibreglass with stainless steel hardware;

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 700



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

c) epoxy-coated rigid steel threaded conduit;
d) PVC-coated rigid steel threaded conduit;
e) 19 mm plywood, either penta-treated or painted with two coats of marine grade paint and used

with galvanized or stainless steel hardware;
f) rigid PVC boxes and enclosures with stainless steel hardware; or
g) hot-dipped galvanized structural steel.
Rule 78-052 2) and 3)
It is the intent of Rule 78-052 2) to ensure that ground fault protection is provided for branch circuits
and feeder circuits installed in or on fixed or floating piers, docking facilities, and boathouses, with a
setting low enough for safe operation but not exceeding 30 mA. There may be instances where the
panelboard or distribution equipment supplying power to the branch circuit is installed in a location
that is not in or on the fixed or floating pier, docking facility, or boathouse. In such cases, Rule 78-052 3)
requires additional ground fault protection to be installed at the branch circuit level, thus fulfilling the
requirements of Rule 78-052 2).

Section 80
Rule 80-000
This Section has the following objectives:
a) to recognize that cathodic protection systems have to be installed using wiring methods that may

not be consistent with those of other Sections of the Code;
b) to address the electrical safety of the cathodic protection systems and not their efficacy.

NACE International Standards are recommended as guides to the design, materials specifications,
installation, and operation of cathodic protection systems.
Rule 80-006
Care should be taken to select clamps that maintain a secure electrical connection and that will be
anodic to the material being protected when in the presence of an electrolyte, so that the clamp will
not itself corrode the material if the connection becomes wet.

When welding to oil or gas piping, reference should be made to CAN/CSA-Z662.

Section 84
Rule 84-000
Where power-generating equipment such as photovoltaic arrays, fuel cells, micro-turbines, etc.,
supplies power through an inverter, the output of the inverter is considered to be the electric power
production source.
Rule 84-002
The consumer electric power generator owner should consult with the supply authority before planning
the interconnection.

The interconnection arrangements should not adversely affect the safety of the supply authority
system.

When interconnected with a supply authority electric system, the output of the electric power
production source should not adversely affect the voltage, frequency, or wave shape of the system to
which it is connected.
Rule 84-008
Where the utility loses one phase of a three-phase system, some transformer configurations allow a
voltage to continue to be present on all phases, and the voltage drop is often not high enough to cause
the electric power production source to shut down. Because the electric power production source

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 701



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

continues to detect a voltage within tolerance on all phases, it is not expected that the electric power
production source is shut down.

The words “disconnected” and “disconnection” in the context of this Rule do not necessarily mean
“disconnecting means” as used elsewhere in the Code.
Rule 84-022
The supply authority disconnecting means is intended to allow the supply authority a single point of
access to simultaneously isolate one or more electric power production sources on the premises. The
main service box, or the equivalent, is normally used to provide this function.
Rule 84-024
In some circumstances, the supply authority may use the provisions of Rule 84-002 to require that the
disconnecting means have “contact operation verifiable by direct visible means”. This is a common
worker-safety feature used by supply authority workers to provide added assurance that the circuit is
open before work is initiated.

Where inverters are used for interconnection, the anti-islanding feature automatically isolates the
generation equipment from the supply authority upon loss of supply authority voltage, so that having
“contact operation verifiable by visible means” may not be required. CSA C22.2 No. 107.1, Clause 14,
applies to interactive inverters and requires the inverter to automatically cease to deliver ac power to
the utility in accordance with an anti-islanding test, within the time specified and after the output
voltage and frequency of the utility source are adjusted to each condition. Utility abandonment of the
interface disconnect switch would require the utility to rely entirely on the inverter to be fail-safe under
normal operation and component fault mode re-energizing a dead utility bus. A small generator can
magnetize a single-phase distribution transformer when the transformer is disconnected from the
primary conductor.
Rule 84-028 2)
The isolating transformer referred to can be remote from or integral to the inverter.
Rule 84-030
The single-line diagram should identify related components of the interconnected system, including
switching arrangements, interlocks, isolation points, and their relative locations. See Figure B64-4 in the
Note to Rule 64-002 for an illustration of an interconnected photovoltaic system.

Section 86
Rule 86-100
Electric vehicle
A “low speed vehicle” or LSV is a class of vehicle described as a small four-wheeled electric vehicle that
can attain a maximum speed of 40 km/h in a distance of 1.6 km. An LSV is designed for use in controlled
areas. There is a maximum weight limit and a requirement that the LSV not use fuel as an on-board
source of energy.

Electric vehicle supply equipment
The primary function of electric vehicle supply equipment is to transfer power for electric vehicle
charging by means (e.g., ac, dc, conductive, or wireless) appropriate for the specific electric vehicle to
which it is connected.

Δ Rule 86-300 1)
This Subrule intends to dedicate branch circuits to supply electric vehicle supply equipment, due to the
specific nature of the demand of the electric vehicle load. Under the provisions of this Subrule, two or
more electric vehicle supply equipment assemblies may be supplied by the same branch circuit if all
other applicable requirements are met.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 702



Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

Rule 86-300 2) and 3)
These requirements are intended to recognize the use of load management systems, from the simplest
manual load transfer type to the automated type, for use with electric vehicle supply equipment and
other loads.
Rule 86-306 1) b)
It is intended by this requirement that, when a connector is used with an attachment plug other than
CSA configuration 5-20P, this connector be a universal plug compatible with the receptacles of the
appropriate CSA configuration as specified in Diagram 1 or 2.
Rule 86-400
It is the intent of this Rule to provide ventilation with electric vehicle supply equipment unless the
equipment is marked for use with electric vehicles not requiring ventilation, or where the
manufacturer’s installation instructions specify that ventilation is not required. When ventilation is
being designed for indoor charging sites where vented storage batteries are used, both supply and
mechanical exhaust equipment should be installed and located to intake from, and vent directly to, the
outdoors.

See the Note to Rule 64-802 for similar considerations.

Tables
Δ Tables 6A to 6K

The calculated values in Tables 6A to 6K are based on conventional concentric stranded conductors as
detailed in Tables 10A and 10B.

The calculated values in these Tables are based on raceways selected from Tables 9A to 9H.

Some raceways are required to contain a separate bonding or grounding conductor. No allowance is
made for extra conductors in Tables 6A to 6K.
Tables 10A, 10B, 10C, and 10D
The diameters of the insulated conductors are calculated based on the nominal diameter of the
conductors for a given class and the nominal thickness of the insulation for the conductor or cable type.
Classes of stranding other than those identified in Tables 10A and 10B are permitted and will result in
different diameters for the same gauge of conductor. Use of higher class stranding could result in the
acceptable conduit fill being exceeded.
Table 32
A light snow area is considered to be an area in which the mean annual recorded depth of snow is
500 mm or less. This information for any area in Canada can be obtained from the following:
a) Meteorological Service of Canada, Environment Canada; and
b) Atlas of Canada, published by Natural Resources Canada.
Tables 33 and 34
The spacings and clearances shown in these tables differ intentionally from those found in
CSA C22.3 No. 1, as explained in Clause 5.2.1 of that Standard:

5.2.1 Construction and day-to-day clearances
The clearances specified in Clause 5 for wires and conductors are minimum values related to
maximum specified loads and service conditions and represent design limits rather than clearances
for construction or day-to-day operation. Clearances under day-to-day conditions are greater than
the minimum clearances specified in Clause 5 when loads and service conditions are less severe
than specified maximum conditions. Clearances provided at the time of construction shall by design
be sufficiently greater than the minimum clearances specified in Clause 5 to ensure that the actual

Appendix B
CSA C22.1:21 Notes on Rules

clearances under maximum specified loads and service conditions meet minimum clearance
requirements.
Note: Clearances specified in the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I, apply at the time of installation rather than
under specified maximum conditions and are therefore larger than those specified in the Canadian Electrical
Code, Part III, for the reasons explained in this Clause.

C11 Code format and Rule terminology
C11.1
Because the CE Code, Part I may be adopted as a regulatory document, it is important that all Rules,
Subrules, and Items be stated in mandatory language in accordance with CSA guidelines. In this respect,
the verb form “shall” must be used rather than “is to be”, “are to be”, “will be”, “should be”, etc., or as
“shall not” if the negative is required. Requirements shall be stated in the positive rather than the
negative.
C11.2
The term “may” shall not be used in a permissive sense because it may indicate to the user or the
enforcer of the Code that the permissive idea may or may not be acceptable to the enforcer. The term
“shall be permitted” shall be used because it indicates definitely that the enforcer has no alternative but
to allow the easement.

Appendix C
The Technical Committee on the Canadian

CSA C22.1:21 Electrical Code, Part I — Organization and rules of procedure

Annex C
Guide to Subcommittee chairs for evaluation of proposals submitted in
accordance with Clause C5.4.1 and for evaluation of Subcommittee

reports required in accordance with Clause C5.4.5
Note: This Annex contains the suggested criteria for evaluating the feasibility of proposals for Code amendments
and of reports provided by the Subcommittee on these proposals.
1) The following are the basic principles for evaluating the submitted proposals. When a request is

made to amend the Code, the following general criteria should be considered:
a) improvements to safety;
b) clarification of the existing wording;
c) correlation with product Standards requirements;
d) technological changes; and
e) correlation with the National Electrical Code, National Building Code of Canada, and other

relevant CSA, NFPA, or ULC Standards (CSA B72, CSA C22.3 No. 1, CSA C22.3 No. 7,CSA C282,
CSA Z32, NFPA 20, CAN/ULC-S524, etc.).

2) The Section Subcommittee that will be deliberating the proposed Code amendment should
consider the following measurement points before accepting the submission for deliberation by
the Subcommittee:
a) Does the subject have relevance to the Code?
b) Are the reasons and supporting information that are required to be submitted with the

proposal deemed sufficient to meet all applied measurement points? (Frivolous proposals
should not be accepted.)

c) Does the subject try to do what has already been attempted? It may be necessary to research
the topic to find out if it has been dealt with in previous years. If the issue was dealt with at a
previous time, it should not be handled again unless there is reason to do so.

d) For a proposed definition, does the term actually appear in the Code? Is a definition really
required or is the terminology used in a dictionary sufficient? Is the definition necessary only
in one Section of the Code or should it be in Section 0 (General Section)?

e) Is it a safety issue? The CE Code is a safety Standard for installation and maintenance only, so
convenience or other issues should not qualify for inclusion.

f) Is the proposal technically sound?
g) Is the proposal dealing with a very prescriptive method that would exclude other methods of

achieving the same desired goal?
h) Is it consistent with the language of the Code?
i) Is this Rule enforceable (i.e., it is written in unambiguous language, using indisputable

criteria)?
Note: The Code user must also be able to determine compliance from a visual inspection of the
installation on site and without the use of supplementary information or judgment. Rules that, in their
wording, require a great deal of judgment on the part of the reader may not be consistently enforced
and are a source of conflict and frustration to users of the Code.

j) Is this proposal consistent with the National Electrical Code? If it is not, there should be
sufficient reasons provided by the submitter.

k) Is the proposal in conflict with other CSA Standards (i.e., the CE Code, Part II Standards) or
other Canadian safety Standards for electrical equipment?
Note: The CE Code, Part I is not supposed to include CE Code, Part II (product design and construction)
or other Canadian safety Standards for electrical equipment requirements, unless it is as an interim
measure and is substantiated accordingly.

Appendix C
The Technical Committee on the Canadian

CSA C22.1:21 Electrical Code, Part I — Organization and rules of procedure

l) Is the proposal in conflict with other relevant Codes, such as the National Building Code of
Canada? Is the proposal in conflict with industry-specific Codes such as NFPA Codes that deal
with specific occupancies, hazardous locations, Codes of practice (e.g., API), CE Code, Part III
Standards, etc.?

m) If accepted, would this proposal have an impact on already certified products (i.e., would the
existing products have to be recertified to meet this new requirement, and is such an
approach justifiable)?

n) Does the subject impact on other Sections, Tables, and Appendices of the Code? If so, have
the potential consequences been reviewed?

o) Does the document style conform with CSA editorial requirements (CSA Guidelines)?
p) Does the proposal introduce amendments that will require new product Standards or changes

to existing product Standards? If so, consideration should be given to including a statement in
the proposal that the amendments, if approved, should be suspended until such time that the
product requirements are in effect.

3) The following are the basic principles for evaluating the Subcommittee recommendation before
reporting it to the Committee on Part I:
a) Is the Subcommittee recommendation understandable and readable?
b) Has the length of the Subcommittee recommendation been reduced to the absolute minimum

necessary to convey the intent? It should be noted that the members of the Committee on
Part I may not have the time to review long subjects when they come in the form of the
Subcommittee recommendation. A suitable one-page summary should be made, especially for
lengthy proposals. This would enable members of the Committee on Part I (who are not
necessarily technical experts in the specific subject area) to understand the key issues,
recommendations, and impacts of the proposal.

c) Has the Subcommittee recommendation expanded to include issues other than that which the
original proposal intended to cover? If so, is this expansion of the subject matter justifiable
(i.e., it was discussed with the submitter and it is accepted by the submitter) or should it be
more appropriately covered by a new subject?

d) Does the Subcommittee recommendation address the issues of the original proposal and
satisfy the submitter’s intent or does it digress?

Notes:
1) Table D3 is calculated for copper conductor sizes No. 18 AWG to No. 4/0 AWG and, for each size specified,

gives the approximate distance in metres to the centre of distribution measured along the insulated
conductor run for a 1% drop in voltage at a given current, with the conductor at a temperature of 60 °C.
Inductive reactance has not been included because it is a function of conductor size and spacing.

2) The distances for a 3% or 5% voltage drop are 3 or 5 times those for a 1% voltage drop.
3) Because the distances in Table D3 are based on conductor resistances at 60 °C, these distances must be

multiplied by the correction factors below according to the temperature rating of the conductor insulation
used and the percentage load with respect to the allowable ampacity. Where the calculation and the
allowable ampacity fall between two columns, the factor in the higher percentage column must be used.

4) For other nominal voltages, multiply the distances in metres by the other nominal voltage (in volts) and divide
by 120.

5) Aluminum conductors have equivalent resistance per unit length to copper conductors that are smaller in
area by two AWG sizes. Table D3 may be used for aluminum conductors because of this relationship, i.e., for
No. 6 AWG aluminum, use the distances listed for No. 8 AWG copper in Table D3. Similarly, for No. 2/0 AWG
aluminum, use the distances for No. 1 AWG copper.

6) The distances and currents listed in Table D3 follow a pattern. When the current, for any conductor size, is
increased by a factor of 10, the corresponding distance decreases by a factor of 10. This relationship can be
used when no value is shown in the table. In that case, look at a current 10 times larger. The distance to the
centre of distribution is then 10 times larger than the listed value.

7) For multi-conductor cables, ensure that the wire size obtained from this Table is suitable for the ampacity
from Table 2 or 4 and Rule 4-004.

8) For currents intermediate to listed values, use the next highest current value.
9) Example of the use of this Table:

Consider a 2-insulated conductor circuit of No. 12 AWG copper NMD90 carrying 16 A at nominal 240 V under
a maximum ambient temperature of 30 °C.

The maximum run distance from the centre of distribution to the load without exceeding a 3% voltage
drop is as follows:
Maximum run length for No. 12 AWG, 16 A, 1% voltage drop at nominal 120 V from this Table is 6.1 m.
Distance correction factor to be used is as follows:
From Table 2, allowable ampacity for 2-insulated conductor No. 12 AWG NMD90 (90 °C rating per
Table 19) is 30 A. The given current is 16 A or 53% (16/30) of the allowable ampacity.
The distance correction factor to be used, from Note 3), 85–90 °C row, 60% column, is 1.04.
The maximum run length is:

If the distance is between 38 and 60.5 m, a larger size of conductor is required, e.g., No. 10 AWG (40 A
allowable ampacity).

* For proper termination of conductors, it is very important that field connections be properly tightened. In the
absence of manufacturer’s instructions on the equipment, the torque values given in Tables D6 and D7 are
recommended. Because it is normal for some relaxation to occur in service, checking torque values some time after
installation is not a reliable means of determining the values of torque applied at installation.
Note: The values in this Table are correlated for consistency with the harmonized Standard CSA C22.2 No. 65.

16 Bedding material for direct buried cables Sand
17 Height above sea level 300 m
18 Latitude** 45 to 49°

* It is important to note that the ampacities listed in Tables D17A to D17N are valid only for the configurations
shown and the conditions specified in Table D17. A change in any one or more installation conditions or cable
construction will result in a change in maximum insulated conductor ampacity.
† It is assumed that insulated conductor shields, ground conductors, and armour (if present) are grounded at more
than one point. The ampacities in the D17 series of Tables have been adjusted to take into consideration the
heating due to shield, ground conductor, and armour circulating currents.
‡ This minimum separation does not apply to sets of cable run in parallel for the same circuit.
§ The maximum concealed vertical distance is intended to be the maximum transition distance from an
underground installation to a pad-mounted (not pole- or building-mounted) device, such as a transformer or
switchgear, where the cables are shaded from direct sunlight and the raceway is ventilated both top and bottom
for air to circulate freely. Pole risers and other vertical runs have not been considered in these calculations and may
be a limiting factor for maximum insulated conductor ampacity.
** This characteristic is applicable only to Tables D17M and D17N for cables exposed to direct sunlight in an
outdoor location (not shaded).

†† Underground ampacities for an insulated conductor or cable temperature of 75 °C may be obtained by
multiplying the appropriate allowable ampacity at 90 °C conductor insulation temperature by the termination
temperature correction factor 0.886. [See Rule 4-006 3) for equipment termination temperature requirements.]

Notes:
1) For buried installations, the values shown may be limited by the maximum earth interface temperature due to

soil moisture migration. Knowledge of local soil conditions is necessary for the determination of the earth
interface temperature to be used. Typical values are between 50 °C and 60 °C, which experience has shown to
be satisfactory for most types of soils.

2) Conduit size is calculated based on 53% fill for a single conductor in conduit.
3) Conductor spacing is the centre-to-centre conduit or conductor spacing, typically 190 mm. For conduits larger

than 103 mm, use an edge-to-edge conduit spacing of 50 mm.

Engineering guidelines for preparing descriptive system documents for intrinsically

CSA C22.1:21 safe electrical systems and non-incendive field wiring circuits

Appendix F — Engineering guidelines for preparing descriptive system
documents for intrinsically safe electrical systems and non-incendive

field wiring circuits
(See Rules 18-002, 18-066, J18-002, and J18-066)

Note: This Appendix is an informative (non-mandatory) part of this Code.

F1 Scope
This Appendix provides guidance for the development of descriptive system documents required for the
installation and verification of intrinsically safe electrical systems and non-incendive field wiring circuits.
It is to be used in conjunction with the reference publications listed in Section F9 of this Appendix.

F2 Intent
Intrinsically safe electrical systems and non-incendive field wiring circuits ensure a high level of safety in
hazardous locations when equipment is properly selected, installed, and maintained. To ensure the
safety of such systems, qualified persons should be provided with sufficient information for installation,
verification, and maintenance. This information is provided in a descriptive system document, which is
integral to the safety of the installation.

F3 Definitions
Note: See Rule 18-002 for definitions of Intrinsically safe circuit, Intrinsically safe electrical system, and Non-
incendive field wiring circuit.

The following definitions apply in this Appendix:

Associated apparatus — electrical equipment that contains both intrinsically safe circuits and non-
intrinsically safe circuits and is constructed so that the non-intrinsically safe circuits cannot adversely
affect the intrinsically safe circuits. Associated apparatus may be
a) equipment additionally protected by a type of protection suitable for use in a given explosive

atmosphere; or
b) equipment not protected by a type of protection suitable for use in an explosive atmosphere and

therefore not to be used in an explosive atmosphere.

Associated non-incendive field wiring apparatus — electrical equipment in which the circuits are not
necessarily non-incendive themselves but that affects the energy in non-incendive field wiring circuits
and is relied upon to maintain non-incendive energy levels. Associated non-incendive field wiring
apparatus may be
a) equipment that has an alternative type of protection suitable for use in a given hazardous location;

or
b) equipment not protected by an alternative type of protection suitable for use in a hazardous

location and therefore not to be used in a hazardous location.

Control drawing — a drawing or other document that is prepared by the manufacturer of the
intrinsically safe apparatus, associated apparatus, non-incendive field wiring apparatus, or the
associated non-incendive field wiring. A control drawing details the electrical parameters governing
interconnections to other circuits or apparatus.

Intrinsically safe apparatus — electrical equipment in which all the circuits are intrinsically safe circuits.

Appendix F
Engineering guidelines for preparing descriptive system documents for intrinsically

CSA C22.1:21 safe electrical systems and non-incendive field wiring circuits

Simple apparatus —
a) an electrical component or combination of components of simple construction with well-defined

electrical parameters that does not generate more than 1.5 V, 100 mA, and 25 mW; or
b) a passive component that does not dissipate more than 1.3 W and is compatible with the intrinsic

safety of the circuit in which it is used.

F4 Technology overview
F4.1 General
Intrinsically safe electrical systems are designed to limit the electrical and thermal energy in a circuit to
a level below what is required to ignite an explosive gas or dust atmosphere. A circuit design should
take into account potential energy that may be present in field devices and interconnecting wiring as
well as fault conditions specified on the basis of the hazardous location where the field device could be
installed so that the overall energy limitations of the system are respected. The application of
intrinsically safe electrical systems technology is generally limited to low-powered instrumentation
circuits.

Intrinsically safe electrical systems and non-incendive field wiring circuits are similar in design and
application. The provisions of this Appendix that apply to intrinsically safe electrical systems also apply
to non-incendive field wiring circuits.
F4.2 Design, application, and installation
F4.2.1
Intrinsically safe circuits vary widely in design, application, and installation requirements. A circuit
typically consists of three components:
a) a field device installed in a hazardous location (the field device may be a simple apparatus or an

intrinsically safe apparatus);
b) a barrier device (an associated apparatus); and
c) the interconnecting wiring.
F4.2.2
Intrinsically safe circuits fall into two categories:
a) circuits for which the manufacturer designs and markets the intrinsically safe field device, the

associated equipment, and the interconnecting wiring as a complete system; or
b) circuits for which the designer selects an intrinsically safe field device and matches its electrical

parameters (commonly known as entity parameters) to the associated equipment and the
interconnecting wiring.

F4.2.3
Field devices that do not store or generate sufficient energy to be a factor in the design of an
intrinsically safe circuit are considered simple apparatus. A simple apparatus does not require a
hazardous location certification when it is protected by an associated apparatus. Examples of simple
apparatus include switches, terminals, terminal boxes, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), resistance
temperature detectors (RTDs), thermocouples, and photocells that do not generate more than 1.5 V,
100 mA, and 25 mW.
F4.2.4
Field devices that do not meet the criteria for simple apparatus are considered intrinsically safe
apparatus. A control drawing issued by the manufacturer of the intrinsically safe apparatus or by a
certification agency is supplied with the device. The control drawing sets out the entity parameters of
the device, which define the maximum voltage, current, inductance, and capacitance that may be
attached to the device for the purposes of a safe installation. Examples of intrinsically safe apparatus
include instrument transmitters, transducers, and solenoids.

Appendix F
Engineering guidelines for preparing descriptive system documents for intrinsically

CSA C22.1:21 safe electrical systems and non-incendive field wiring circuits

F4.2.5
Associated apparatus (e.g., barrier devices) are designed to serve as an interface between intrinsically
safe circuit devices and a non-intrinsically safe circuit and to limit the energy in the intrinsically safe
circuit. The technology employed may consist of a Zener barrier, galvanic isolation, and/or power-
limiting communication bus technology. A control drawing issued by the manufacturer of the associated
apparatus or by a certification agency is supplied with the associated apparatus. The control drawing
sets out the electrical parameters of the associated apparatus, which define its capacity to protect a
field device and associated wiring.
F4.2.6
The cumulative energy-storing effect of distributed inductance and capacitance in the field wiring
should be considered in the design of an intrinsically safe electrical system. Inductance and capacitance
values for the wire can be obtained from the wire manufacturer, which allows the electrical parameters
of the wiring for the application to be calculated based on the length of the wire.
F4.2.7
The designer of the intrinsically safe electrical system selects appropriate equipment and documents the
interconnection requirements in a descriptive system document, taking into account the entity
parameters given in the control drawings. The descriptive system document is intended to facilitate the
safe installation, verification, and maintenance of the intrinsically safe electrical system.
F4.2.8
The following publications are useful references for determining the interconnection requirements for
intrinsically safe circuits:
a) ISA TR12.2 outlines a method of matching the entity parameters of intrinsically safe field devices

with the parameters of associated equipment and interconnecting wiring. This publication is useful
for assessing relatively simple intrinsically safe circuits.

b) CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-25 applies to all aspects of intrinsically safe design, including bonding
and grounding. This publication outlines procedures for the design and assessment of all types of
intrinsically safe circuits, including more complex circuit designs incorporating multiple field devices
and sources of power.

F4.2.9
Intrinsically safe electrical systems and non-incendive field wiring circuits are suitable for use in
hazardous locations as shown in the following table:

Equipment Suitable for use in
Intrinsically safe apparatus and associated All hazardous locations
apparatus marked “Intrinsically Safe”, “IS”, “I.S.”,

iii) Ex ib;
iv) Ex ic; or
v) non-incendive (Ex nL);

d) the temperature class or maximum surface temperature of the equipment, in accordance with
Rule 18-054;

e) the ambient temperature range if components will be subject to temperatures outside the
operating temperature range of –20 °C to 40 °C;

f) entity parameters of all intrinsically safe apparatus;
g) entity parameters of associated apparatus, where applicable;
h) identification of simple apparatus in the circuit;
i) evaluation of the entity parameters for a safe installation;
j) electrical parameters for the interconnecting wiring or specification of the type of cable to be used,

including the maximum length permitted and the justification for its use;
k) details of grounding and bonding requirements, clearly indicating which point or points of the

system are intended to be connected to the plant reference potential and any special requirements
for such a bond; bonding of cable screens should also be indicated;

l) when surge protection devices are used, identification of the manufacturer and model number (the
capacitance and inductance of the surge suppression devices must be considered in the
assessment of the intrinsically safe electrical system); and

m) reference to a manufacturer’s or certification agency’s control drawing(s), where applicable.

The content of a descriptive system document may be presented in table format or in the context of a
drawing. Examples of drawings are provided in CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-25 and ISA RP12.02.02.

F6 Engineering authentication
When an engineer is involved, all descriptive system documents and supporting calculations should be
traceable to a registered professional engineer working under a permit to practice, or the system should
be certified by an accredited certification organization. Traceability and authentication requirements are
governed by the particular jurisdiction, but typically this means that drawings and reports are
a) signed and stamped; or
b) signed with the title “P. Eng.” (or equivalent).

F7 Documentation and records
Descriptive system documents and supporting calculations should be maintained on file with the
owner/operator of the facility for the life of the facility. These records should be accessible, upon
request, by installers, inspectors, and operations, safety, and maintenance personnel.

Appendix H
CSA C22.1:21 Combustible gas detection equipment for use in explosive gas atmospheres

Appendix H — Combustible gas detection equipment for use in explosive
gas atmospheres

(See Rules 18-070 and J18-068)
Note: This Appendix is an informative (non-mandatory) part of this Code.

H1 Introduction
H1.1 General
Combustible gas detection is frequently used to monitor flammable gas or vapour concentrations in
enclosed spaces. Combustible gas detectors may be portable hand-held devices or equipment
permanently installed in a hazardous location.
H1.2 Portable combustible gas detectors
Portable combustible gas detectors can be used to
a) provide advance warning to personnel when flammable gas or vapour concentrations in the air

reach unsafe levels;
b) identify locations and prompt corrective action in process buildings where pockets of flammable

gas or vapour could persist in normal operation; and
c) monitor potential sources of release where hot work is in progress.
H1.3 Permanently installed combustible gas detectors
Permanently installed combustible gas detectors can be used to
a) meet the requirements of Rule 18-068 allowing for the use of equipment not rated for the

particular hazardous area;
b) verify that the design of ventilation systems is such that fugitive emissions will be diluted to safe

concentrations as prescribed in API RP 500, API RP 505, and IEC 60079-10-1;
c) monitor the normal operation of process equipment to ensure that it is operating within its design

parameters. Small but measurable increases in the background concentration of flammable
materials in an enclosed space can provide an early indication of a potential problem with the
process that, if not corrected, could lead to a major containment failure resulting in large releases
of flammable material, which could in turn require total shutdown of the process; and

d) detect failures in process equipment that could result in large releases of flammable material,
necessitating prompt operator intervention or automated shutdown.

H1.4
Combustible gas detection equipment should never be used as a substitute for safe electrical design.
Because such devices may not perform as intended, as a result of poor maintenance, adverse conditions
(sensor poisoning), or deliberate tampering, they should be used only where installation, operation, and
maintenance are performed by qualified personnel in accordance with the gas detection equipment
manufacturer’s recommendations and/or recognized industry standards.

H2 General
H2.1
This Appendix applies to combustible gas detection equipment consisting of permanently installed point
detectors of the stationary type certified to the requirements of CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-29-1. Open
path (line-of-sight) gas detectors are not suitable for use with Rules 18-070 and J18-068 because they
do not provide information sufficient for remedial action about the percentage of the lower flammable
limit (% LFL) of gas concentration at a specific location along the sight path. Open path detectors
provide an average measurement over the complete sight path.
H2.2
Gas detection equipment is certified for the designated gas group to be encountered and calibrated
specifically for the gas or vapour to be detected. If more than one gas or vapour could be present, the

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 813



Appendix H
CSA C22.1:21 Combustible gas detection equipment for use in explosive gas atmospheres

gas detector should be capable of detecting all gases and vapours that could be encountered, with a
direct reading for the gas that gives the lowest response. Since combustible gas detectors are able to
provide correct readings only for the gas or vapour for which they have been calibrated, a correction
factor is applied for an accurate reading of other gases or vapours. The manufacturer’s instruction
manual typically provides such correction factors for specific gases or vapours when standard
calibration gases are used.
H2.3
Combustible gas detection equipment is certified in accordance with CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-29-1 for
its ability to function satisfactorily within certain environmental parameters involving temperature,
humidity, air velocity, and vibration. Reference should be made to these Standards to determine if the
expected environmental operating conditions of the gas detection equipment application in question
fall within the parameters specified in the product Standards. Equipment applications involving
environmental conditions outside the specified parameters should be given special consideration. In
addition, for the continued satisfactory performance of gas detection equipment under various
environmental operating conditions, consideration should be given to environmental factors such as the
following:
a) Temperature — The manufacturer’s data should be consulted to ensure that the gas detector

instrument sensor and controller are suitable for the temperature range of the application.
Operating the equipment outside the manufacturer’s specified operating range can result in a slow
or erroneous response to a release of flammable gas or vapour.

b) Airborne particles — Airborne particles, such as dust, fibres, and aerosols, can affect the diffusion
of the atmosphere to the sensing element of combustible gas detection equipment. Sensors should
be adequately guarded against particle contamination through proper maintenance based on
operating experience. The provision of contaminant-excluding hardware and the orientation and
location of sensing elements can also help to minimize such effects. Similar consideration should
be given to protecting sensors from the effects of rain, ice, and snow.

c) Contaminants — The gas sensing element of catalytic sensor combustible gas detection equipment
may be susceptible to desensitization by certain airborne compounds, such as silicone, silanes,
halogenated compounds, etc., as listed in the manufacturer’s instruction manual. The possible
effect of such exposure should be considered when such compounds are used in the vicinity of
catalytic sensor combustible gas sensors. Where such compounds are integral to the process in the
area monitored, point-type infrared sensor gas detection equipment may be more appropriate.

d) Corrosive compounds — For satisfactory operation of combustible gas detection equipment, the
presence of corrosive compounds in the area monitored should be taken into consideration both
for material compatibility and for compatibility with any gases that could be generated as a result
of chemical reactions involving such corrosive compounds.

H3 Application recommendations
H3.1
Provided that combustible gas detection is used as a means of equipment protection, Rules 18-070 and
J18-068 permit the installation of
a) equipment suitable for non-hazardous locations in Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2) locations; and
b) equipment suitable for Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2) locations in Zone 1 (Class I, Division 1) locations.

Equipment for ordinary (non-hazardous) locations can be ignition capable. If the equipment
incorporates components that arc or spark in normal operation or operate at surface temperatures
above the auto-ignition temperature defined for a given hazardous location, the use of combustible gas
detection as a means of equipment protection is not appropriate. The provisions in Rules 18-070 and
J18-068 are based on the following conditions: that the equipment, during its normal operation, does
not produce arcs, sparks, or hot surfaces capable of igniting an explosive gas atmosphere and that no
suitable equipment certified for the designated hazardous location is available. The provisions are not

Appendix H
CSA C22.1:21 Combustible gas detection equipment for use in explosive gas atmospheres

intended to be applied as an alternative to using properly certified equipment in a hazardous location.
See the Appendix B Notes to Section 18 and the Annex JB Notes to Annex J18 for further guidance on
the application and intent of the Rules related to gas detection.
H3.2
Where equipment is installed in accordance with Rule 18-070 or J18-068, consideration should be given
to the consequences of disconnecting power to the equipment being protected. The equipment should
be capable of being switched off at any time, without warning and without causing any personnel or
operational safety hazards. Essential services such as lighting, instruments required for the safe
operation of the process, and the gas detection equipment itself must be certified for the designated
hazardous area classification.
H3.3
It may be necessary to use combustible gas detection equipment in enclosed locations designated
Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2) to ensure the integrity of the designated classification. Locations designated
Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2) require two conditions to be met: first, that it is not likely that an explosive
gas atmosphere will exist in normal operation and, secondly, that if an explosive gas atmosphere does
occur, it will exist for a short time only (see Rules 18-002 and J18-004). The primary purpose of
combustible gas detection equipment in such applications is to activate an alarm when abnormally high
concentrations of flammable gas or vapour are present so that steps can be taken to ensure that they
will be eliminated within the “short time” requirement in the Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2) definition. The
generally accepted rule of thumb for the “short time” requirement for Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2)
locations is that an explosive gas atmosphere will be present in an area a total of 10 h or less per year
(see API RP 505).
H3.4
Enclosed facilities that are not monitored on a continuous basis may require some means of ensuring
that the “short time” criterion is met. This is to prevent the possibility of an undetected flammable gas
release persisting longer than the 10 h per year industry standard. The use of gas detection equipment
in such situations is highly recommended.
H3.5
The application of combustible gas detection equipment by itself does not designate an enclosed
location Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2). An appropriate ventilation design is also required. For additional
information on the ventilation design of enclosed classified locations, see the selected references listed
in Appendix L, Clause L14.2.
H3.6
Additional considerations related to alarm response time apply to remote, unmanned facilities. If an
operator cannot respond to an alarm within the “short time” required for the Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2)
designation, an enclosed location in such facilities should be classified Zone 1 (Class I, Division 1), not
Zone 2 (Class I, Division 2).

H4 Installation recommendations
H4.1
Consideration should be given to the following factors when locating remote detector heads (sensors):
a) the density of the gases or vapours to be detected (in relation to air);
b) the locations of the potential gas or vapour sources and the hazardous area classification for which

the equipment is certified;
c) provision for extra (i.e., redundant) detector heads;
d) the effects of ventilation systems on the flow of hazardous gases or vapours from the hazardous

location and the possibility of gas or vapour concentration gradients in the hazardous location;
e) adverse environments at detector locations; and
f) accessibility for calibration and maintenance.

Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

Annex JB
Notes to Rules for Annexes J18 and J20

Rule J18-000
Through the exercise of ingenuity in the layout of electrical installations for hazardous locations, it is
frequently possible to locate much of the equipment in a reduced level of classification or in a non-
hazardous area and thus to reduce the amount of special equipment required.

To assist users in the proper design and selection of equipment for electrical installations in hazardous
locations, numerous reference documents are available. See Table B18-1 for a list of the commonly
referenced documents.
Rule J18-002

Δ Explosion seal — a seal that is intended to prevent hot gases resulting from ignition of an explosive gas
atmosphere on one side of the seal from igniting an explosive gas atmosphere on the other side of the
seal (or, in the case of a cable seal, igniting an explosive gas atmosphere external to the cable). The
design of these seals also minimizes the passage through them of flammable fluids under atmospheric
pressure.

Δ Flammable fluid migration seal — a seal that is only intended to prevent the passage of flammable fluid
at atmospheric pressure. A flammable fluid migration seal is not intended to prevent the transmission
of an explosion or of flammable fluids under pressure. While explosion seals can meet this definition
(see the Note to Rule J18-070), other methods using compounds such as silicone or duct seal are also
suitable, provided that they are installed in a manner that will prevent migration of flammable fluids at
atmospheric pressure.

Δ Primary process seal — a seal that is typically a part of electrical devices such as pressure-,
temperature-, or flow-measuring devices and equipment such as canned pumps which are in direct
contact with the flammable process fluid and prevents passage of that fluid into the electrical
connections or equipment.

Δ Secondary process seal — a seal that is designed to prevent flammable process fluids from entering the
electrical wiring system upon failure of a primary process seal. These devices typically prevent passage
of fluids at process pressure by a combination of sealing and pressure relief. It can be incorporated into
an electrical device or can be field installed on the wiring system that connects to the device.

Δ Single or dual process seal equipment — an electrical device can be marked with either designation to
indicate that it incorporates into its construction and certification, primary or primary and secondary
process seals that will prevent the migration of flammable fluids into the wiring system, as specified in
UL 122701 or IEC TS 60079-40.
Rule J18-004
Division 1 area classifications
Typical situations leading to a Division 1 area classification are
a) the interiors of storage tanks that are vented to atmosphere and that contain flammable liquids

stored above their flash point;
b) enclosed sumps containing flammable liquids stored above their flash point during normal

operation;
c) the area immediately around atmospheric vents;
d) inadequately ventilated buildings or enclosures; and

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 853



Appendix J
Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

e) adequately ventilated buildings or enclosures, such as remote unattended and unmonitored
facilities, that have insufficient means of limiting the duration of explosive gas atmospheres when
they do occur.

Division 2 area classifications
Typical situations leading to a Division 2 area classification are
a) areas where flammable volatile liquids, flammable gases, or vapours are handled, processed, or

used, but in which liquids, gases, or vapours are normally confined within closed containers or
closed systems from which they can escape only as a result of accidental rupture or breakdown of
the containers or systems or the abnormal operation of the equipment by which the liquids or
gases are handled, processed, or used;

b) adequately ventilated buildings that have means of ensuring that the length of time during which
abnormal operation resulting in the occurrence of explosive gas atmospheres can exist will be
limited to a “short time”; and

c) most outdoor areas except those around open vents, or open vessels or sumps containing
flammable liquids.

API RP 500 defines “adequate ventilation” as “ventilation (natural or artificial) that is sufficient to
prevent the accumulation of significant quantities of vapour-air or gas-air mixtures in concentrations
above 25% of their lower flammable limit, LFL”. Annex B of API RP 500 outlines a method for calculating
the ventilation requirements for enclosed areas based on fugitive emissions.

Industry documents such as API RP 505 provide guidance on how industry interprets a “short time”.

Flammable mists may form or be present at the same time as flammable gas or vapour. In such cases,
the strict application of the details in the classification Standards referenced might not be appropriate.
Flammable mists can also form when liquids not considered to be a hazard due to their high flash point
are released under pressure. In these cases, the classifications and details in the Standards referenced
do not apply. Information on flammable mists can be found in industry Standards such as
IEC 60079-10-1.

Δ Rules J18-004, J18-006, and J18-008
Reference material for area classification is listed in Table B18-1.

See also the Note to Rule J18-064 in this Annex.

There is an equivalency in area classifications between the Zone system and the Class/Division system
as shown in Table B18-2. For equipment suitable for installation in hazardous locations, refer to
Tables 18 and 18A.
Rule J18-006
Class II, Division 1 locations usually include the working areas of grain-handling and storage plants;
rooms containing grinders or pulverizers, cleaners, graders, scalpers, open conveyors or spouts, open
bins or hoppers, mixers or blenders, automatic or hopper scales, packing machinery, elevator heads and
boots, stock distributors, dust and stock collectors (except all-metal collectors vented to the outside),
and all similar dust-producing machinery and equipment in grain processing plants, starch plants, sugar
pulverizing plants, malting plants, hay grinding plants, and other occupancies of similar nature; coal
pulverizing plants (except where the pulverizing equipment is essentially dust-tight); all working areas
where metal dusts and powders are produced, processed, handled, packed, or stored (except in tight
containers); and all other similar locations where combustible dust may, under normal operating
conditions, be present in the air in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitable mixtures.

Combustible dusts that are electrically non-conducting will include dusts produced in the handling and
processing of grain and grain products, pulverized sugar and cocoa, dried egg and milk powders,
pulverized spices, starch and pastes, potato and wood flour, oil meal from beans and seeds, dried hay,

Appendix J
Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

and other organic materials that may produce combustible dusts when processed or handled. Only
Group E dusts are considered electrically conductive for the purposes of classification. Metallic dusts of
magnesium, aluminum, and aluminum bronze are particularly hazardous, and every precaution should
be taken to avoid ignition and explosion.

Class II, Division 2 locations include those in which dangerous concentrations of suspended dust are not
likely, but where dust accumulation might form on, in, or in the vicinity of electrical equipment, and
include rooms and areas containing only closed spouting and conveyors, closed bins or hoppers, or
machines and equipment from which appreciable quantities of dust might escape only under abnormal
conditions; rooms or areas adjacent to Class II, Division 1 locations and into which explosive or ignitable
concentrations of suspended dust might be communicated only under abnormal operating conditions;
rooms or areas where the formulation of explosive or ignitable concentrations of suspended dust is
prevented by the operation of effective dust control equipment; warehouses and shipping rooms in
which dust-producing materials are stored or handled only in bags or containers; and other similar
locations.

There are many dusts, such as fine sulphur dust, that cannot be equated specifically to dusts mentioned
above, and in a number of cases further information may be obtained by reference to Standards
included in the NFPA National Fire Codes; for example, NFPA 655 gives information on prevention of
sulphur fires and explosions and makes reference to electrical wiring and equipment.
Rule J18-008
Class III, Division 1 locations include parts of rayon, cotton, and other textile mills; combustible fibre
manufacturing and processing plants; cotton gins and cotton-seed mills; flax processing plants; clothing
manufacturing plants; woodworking plants; and establishments and industries involving similar
hazardous processes or conditions.

Readily ignitable fibres and flyings include rayon, cotton (including cotton linters and cotton waste), sisal
or henequen, istle, jute, hemp, tow, cocoa fibre, oakum, baled waste kapok, Spanish moss, excelsior,
and other materials of similar nature.
Rule J18-010
Maintaining electrical installation safety in hazardous locations is dependent on a regimen of regular
maintenance that will ensure that the electrical installation continues to provide safety throughout its
life. Maintenance personnel are cautioned that modifications to original equipment or substitution of
original components may void certification. In addition to the manufacturer’s instructions, the following
documents may be used to guide owners and operators of hazardous locations in developing
appropriate maintenance procedures:
a) IEC 60079-17, Explosive atmospheres — Part 17: Electrical installations inspection and

maintenance;
b) IEC 60300 series of Standards, Dependability management;
c) IEEE 902, IEEE Guide for Maintenance, Operation, and Safety of Industrial and Commercial Power

Systems; and
d) NFPA 70B, Recommended Practice for Electrical Equipment Maintenance.
Rules J18-050 and J18-066
Table 18 provides a summary of what equipment types are suitable for installation in the various
hazardous locations.

It should be noted that battery-operated and self-generating equipment is not excluded from the Rules
of Annex J18, regardless of the voltage involved. Examples of such equipment are flashlights,
transceivers, paging receivers, tape recorders, combustion gas detectors, vibration monitors,
tachometers, battery- or voice-powered telephones, and portable test equipment that may be carried
into or located within a hazardous area. Such equipment may be eligible for approval under CAN/CSA-
C22.2 No. 157.

Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

Where general-purpose enclosures are used for such equipment and the Rules of Annex J18 require the
equipment to be specifically approved for the hazardous location, the electrical equipment is required
to be approved for the location as intrinsically safe in accordance with Rule J18-066 and marked in
accordance with Rule J18-052.

In cases where the Rules of Annex J18 permit general-purpose enclosures with the qualification that
acceptable non-incendive circuits be incorporated, the electrical equipment should be approved as such
and marked in accordance with Rule J18-052.
Rule J18-050 2) a)
Information on classification of areas (as well as ventilation requirements) in plants engaged in the
generation and compression of acetylene and in the charging of acetylene cylinders may be found in
NFPA 51A.
Rule J18-050 2) d)
Information on classification of areas for refrigeration systems utilizing flammable gases (including
ammonia) may be found in CSA B52.
Rule J18-052
Electrical equipment certified for Class I, II, or III hazardous locations has the following markings:
• For Class I or II, Division 1 or 2 locations, the equipment is marked with the Class and Group

described in Rules J18-050 and J18-052 or with the Class and specific gas or vapour for which it is
certified.

• For Class I, Division 2 only, the equipment may be marked as Class I, Division 2.
• For Class II and III locations, the equipment is marked as Class II and/or III, and for Class II, also for

the group or specific dust for which it is certified.
• For Class I or II locations, the equipment is marked with the maximum surface temperature in

degrees Celsius or one of the temperature codes given in Table JB-1.

Appendix J
Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

The maximum surface temperature rating of equipment is based on a 40 °C ambient temperature,
except that if the equipment is rated for a higher ambient temperature, it is marked as such.

Equipment marked for Class I but not marked with a Division is suitable for both Divisions 1 and 2.

Where equipment is certified to the 60079 series of Standards, it will be marked with one or more
“Types of Protection”, as indicated in Table 18.

The mark includes the letters “Ex” to indicate that the equipment is “explosion protected”, followed by
one or more of the symbols.

Where equipment uses more than one type of protection, each type of protection is shown. For
example, equipment suitable for Zone 1 with flameproof “d” components and increased safety “e”
terminals is marked with “Ex db eb”. Refer to Table 18, and the Note to Rule 18-052 in Appendix B for
more information.

Exposure of hazardous locations equipment to ambient temperatures that are outside the intended
ambient temperature range of the equipment can affect the explosion protection features of such
equipment. Some equipment may be marked with a safe ambient temperature range in accordance
with the relevant Canadian Electrical Code, Part II product Standards, but other equipment may not
have such markings.

Hazardous locations equipment subjected to ambient temperature conditions exceeding the design
maximum ambient temperature can result in the equipment operating at a temperature in excess of the
maximum (surface) temperature marked on the nameplate of the equipment, possibly exceeding
maximum internal operating temperature limits as well as the temperature limits stated in Rule 18-054.

Hazardous locations equipment subjected to ambient temperature conditions that are colder than the
design low ambient temperature can result in the equipment being subjected to excessive explosion
pressures due to higher gas densities at low temperatures. Cold temperatures also affect the brittleness
of materials, which can also compromise the explosion protection integrity of the equipment.

Note that ambient temperatures marked on equipment apply to explosion protection safety only.
Equipment performance is not considered.

Where an ambient temperature range is not indicated on equipment, the default temperatures are as
follows:
a) for products marked “Ex”, the design ambient temperature range is (–20 °C ≤ ambient ≤ 40 °C); and
b) for products marked Class I, II, or III, Division 1 or 2, the design ambient temperature range is

(–50 °C ≤ ambient ≤ 40 °C).
Rules J18-052, J18-100, and J18-150
The 2011 edition of CSA C22.2 No. 60079-0 [adopted IEC 60079-0 (fifth edition, 2007-10)] introduces
“equipment protection levels” (EPLs) as a required marking on hazardous location electrical equipment
certified to the IEC 60079 series of Standards. This marking will appear on new electrical equipment
that is designed in accordance with the adopted 60079 series of Standards. For older equipment, in
stock or in the field, that does not include the EPL marking, suitability for the intended zone will
continue to be determined by the types of protection. EPLs will enable users to identify the zone(s) in
which the IEC 60079 type of hazardous location electrical equipment can be used, without having to
identify the zone by the types of protection used.

EPLs provide an indication of the suitability of electrical equipment for each zone. Further information
on EPLs can be found in CSA C22.2 No. 60079-0. Table JB-2 shows the acceptable EPLs for Divisions 1
and 2.

Notes:
1) Most of the values in this Table have been obtained from IEC 60079-20-1, Explosive atmospheres —

Part 20-1: Material characteristics for gas and vapour classification — Test methods and data, Edition 1.0,
2010-01. In many cases, the name used in the IEC Standard differs from the name typically used in North
America for the same substance. In fact, chemicals may have several different names. The CAS numbering
system referenced in this table is a well-known method of uniquely identifying chemicals and is a required
feature of MSDS documentation. Further information on the CAS numbering system may be found at
www.cas.org.

2) This substance is not listed in IEC 60079-20-1.
3) Natural gas is classified as Group IIA, provided that it does not contain more than 25% (by volume) of

hydrogen.
4) Gasoline is identified under several CAS numbers.
Rules J18-054 and J18-150
Equipment of the heat-producing type is currently required by product Standards to have a temperature
code (T-Code) marking if its temperature exceeds 100 °C. However, for equipment manufactured prior
to the T-Code requirement and motors applied in accordance with Rule J18-150, there may be no such
marking. Therefore, the suitability of older hazardous locations equipment of the heat-producing type
and motors applied in accordance with Rule J18-150 should be reviewed prior to being installed in a
hazardous location to ensure compliance with Rule J18-054. For the purpose of these Rules, equipment
such as boxes, terminals, fittings, and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are not considered to be
heat-producing devices.

Determination of the maximum surface temperatures for Rule J18-054 is set by the area classification
for the location in which the equipment is installed. This is normally based on the minimum ignition
temperature of the flammable or combustible substances that may be released into the atmosphere in
that location. The temperature markings on electrical equipment are in accordance with the
requirements in the Canadian Electrical Code, Part II product Standards, which set the specifications
determining where surface temperature measurements are taken. For equipment suitable for Class I
areas, this applies to both external and, where gases can reach an internal surface, internal
temperatures. For equipment suitable for Class II and III areas, this applies to external surfaces only. The
design of equipment for explosive dust atmospheres, with gasketing and other features to prevent
ingress of dusts, is such that the only concern for ignition is on the exterior of the equipment.
Therefore, the maximum surface temperature requirement for dusts applies to the external surfaces of
the equipment only.

Rule J18-060
For the purpose of this Rule, metal-covered cable includes a cable with a metal sheath or with a metal
armour of the interlocking type, the insulated conductor type, or the flat-tape type or with metal
shielding.
Rule J18-060 1)
Suitable lightning protective devices should include primary devices and also secondary devices if
overhead secondary lines exceed 90 m in length or if the secondary is ungrounded.

Interconnection of all grounds should include grounds for primary and secondary lightning protective
devices, secondary system grounds, if any, and grounds of conduit and equipment of the interior wiring
system.
Rule J18-060 2) b)
Where single-conductor metal-covered or armoured cables with jackets are used in hazardous
locations, the armour must be grounded in only the hazardous location to prevent circulating currents.
As a result, there will be a standing voltage on the metal covering in the non-hazardous location area.
There is, therefore, a need to properly isolate the armour in the non-hazardous area to ensure that
circulating currents will not occur.

Δ Rule J18-062
Optical fiber cables and equipment are being used more often due to advancements in technology in
hazardous locations, as can be seen by the recognition of optical radiation as a potential explosion
hazard and the adoption of CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-28 for optical equipment. It is important that
these cables are recognized for installation in hazardous locations and that they are installed to
minimize the risks of fire, explosions, and transmission of flammable fluids.

Some of these cables contain both wiring and fiber elements within them, and they are considered
electrical cables [see Rule 56-204 2)]. As such, they need to meet the “Wiring methods” Rules for the
applicable Class and Division.

When optical fiber cables are intermixed with electrical cables, they are also subject to the
requirements in Section 56.
Rule J18-064
To meet the intent of this Rule for effectively maintaining a protective gas pressure, the following
references for pressurization are recommended:
a) CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60079-2, Explosive atmospheres — Part 2: Equipment protection by pressurized

enclosure “p”;
b) NFPA 496, Standard for Purged and Pressurized Enclosures for Electrical Equipment; and

Δ c) CSA C60079-13, Explosive atmospheres — Part 13: Equipment protection by pressurized room “p”
and artificially ventilated room “v”.

Δ Rule J18-066
See the Note to Rules J18-050 and J18-066.

When reference is made to intrinsically safe systems, including equipment, wiring, and installation, the
term used is “intrinsically safe”. When reference is made to product certification and markings, the
terms used are
a) intrinsic safety “ia”, “ib”, or “ic” for Zone hazardous locations; or
b) intrinsically safe “Exi”, “Exia”, “Intrinsically Safe”, “IS”, or “I.S.” for Class I, II, or III hazardous

locations.

Non-incendive terminology may be used to describe non-incendive components, circuits, equipment,
and wiring. Non-incendive components and circuits are typically integral to non-incendive equipment,
which is designed to prevent the ignition of the flammable atmospheres under normal operation. Non-

Appendix J
Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

incendive components are used where the energy in the circuit is ignition capable but ignition of the
flammable atmosphere is prevented by one or more of the following technologies:
• incorporating non-ignition-capable components;
• hermetically sealing ignition-capable components; and
• incorporating enclosed break device technology similar in design to a flameproof “d” or flameproof

“db” enclosure.

Non-incendive circuits within the equipment prevent the ignition of the flammable atmosphere by
limiting the energy within the circuit to a level below the energy required to ignite a flammable
material. Non-incendive equipment may also be designated to have non-incendive wiring circuits. Non-
incendive wiring circuits are designed to be connected to other equipment or to associated non-
incendive wiring apparatus as specified by the manufacturer’s control drawing and the descriptive
system document. A non-incendive wiring circuit is considered to provide the same level of protection
as a field wiring circuit with methods of protection “nL” or “ic”. Non-incendive equipment that does not
have designated non-incendive wiring circuits should be installed using the standard wiring methods
and sealing for the applicable location. For additional information related to the application of non-
incendive components, circuits, equipment, and wiring, refer to CSA C22.2 No. 213.
Rule J18-066 1) and 2)
The descriptive system document is necessary to ensure that all aspects of the intrinsically safe or non-
incendive wiring installation are addressed and documented. See Appendix F for additional information
regarding descriptive system documents.
Rule J18-068
The definition of lower and upper explosive limits (LELs and UELs) in Rule J18-002 has been changed to
lower and upper flammable limits (LFLs and UFLs) and, therefore, has been revised in this Rule.
Flammable limits are material properties that are covered in documents such as IEC 60079-20-1.
Explosive limits depend on installation factors such as enclosure geometry or igniter location and
generally fall within a narrower range than flammable limits. Therefore, flammable limits are now used
because they are fixed values, define a wider range than explosive limits, and are harmonized with IEC
area classification Standards.
Note: Combustible gas detectors read LFL even though the scale may be marked as LEL.

It is intended that this Rule be used only where suitable equipment, certified for use in the hazardous
location, is not available. For example, Class I, Division 1 ignition systems for internal combustion
engines are not available; only Class I, Division 2 ignition systems are available. Therefore, ignition
systems rated for Class I, Division 2 are currently the only hazardous location ignition systems that are
available and could possibly be used in Class I, Division 1 locations.

In many situations, proper area classification eliminates the need to use this Rule. This Rule should not
be used to compensate for improper area classification.

When this Rule is used, the gas detection system should consist of an adequate number of sensors to
ensure the sensing of flammable gases or vapours in all areas where they may accumulate.

Electrical equipment suitable for non-hazardous locations and having unprotected arcing, sparking, or
heat-producing components must not be installed in a Division 2 location. Arcing, sparking, or heat-
producing components may be protected by encapsulating, hermetically sealing, or sealing by other
means such as restricted breathing.

Before applying this Rule, the user should fully understand the risks associated with such an installation.
When this Rule is being applied, it remains the responsibility of the owner of the facility, or agents of
the owner, to ensure that the resulting installation is safe. Simply complying with the requirements of
this Rule may not ensure a safe installation in all situations.

Δ Rule J18-070
See Figures JB18-2 and JB18-3 for a flow chart detailing where explosion, flammable fluid migration, or
process seals should be selected for installations using cables and conduits.

UL 122701 and IEC TS 60079-40 provide construction, performance, and marking requirements for
process seals incorporated into process-connected electrical equipment. Equipment containing a
primary or a primary and secondary process seal that complies with these Standards is eligible to
include either the “Single Seal” or “Dual Seal” designation in the nameplate markings. These markings
indicate that the electrical equipment is designed to prevent the migration of flammable fluid through
the equipment into the wiring system when the equipment is operated at or lower than its rated
pressure. Devices certified as conforming to UL 122701 or IEC TS 60079-40 and marked either “Single
Seal” or “Dual Seal” meet the intent of Subrule 1) a). See Figure JB18-1 for typical configurations of
process seals.

Where devices containing primary process seals are not marked to indicate conformance with
UL 122701 or IEC TS 60079-40, other means may be used to prevent fluid migration though the wiring
system. This may include the use of suitable barriers located between the primary process seal and the
wiring system, such as secondary process seals or short lengths of mineral-insulated (MI) cable.
IEEE 1673 provides construction, performance, and marking requirements for field-installed secondary
process seals. Where secondary process seals are installed, examples of design features that make the
occurrence of primary process seal failure obvious are vents, drains, visible rupture or leakage, audible
whistles, or electronic monitoring. The intent of making the primary process seal failure obvious is to
prevent continuous pressure on the secondary process seal and the possibility of an eventual secondary
process seal failure, as well as to protect personnel working on the device. Alternatively, where means
to relieve pressure on a secondary process seal is not provided, a cautionary label should be provided to
warn personnel that the enclosure may contain flammable fluid under pressure

Process (flammable fluid) sealing is also required in subsurface applications, e.g., oil and gas wells.
Wiring and fiber optic systems have to be process sealed as they pass through the surface wellhead to
prevent flammable fluids from migrating through the wiring and fiber optic systems on the surface.
Implementing a field-installed secondary process seal on downhole equipment would be difficult
because of the need for a primary process seal with annunciation of failure. Sealing should incorporate
both primary and secondary process seals, which can be designated either “Single Seal” or “Dual Seal”,
as applicable.

Engineering considerations may lead to the conclusion that the probability of leakage from a specific
installation will be negligible. Acceptable factors such as an extensive history of safe operation with
similar installations, or the use of a primary process seal with a pressure rating well in excess of the
maximum process operating pressure, may be considered.

In conduit systems, the function of the primary and secondary process seals is to prevent flammable
fluids (liquid, gas, or vapour) that may be under pressure from getting into the conduit system. Beyond
the primary and secondary process seals, there is no opportunity for gas under significant pressure to
enter the conduit. However, it is important to understand that in some situations [e.g., where fluids
under pressure are located in an enclosed space (such as in gas sample tubing inside a control panel)],
conduits and cables entering the enclosure may require sealing (a secondary process seal) in case there
is a leak under pressure from sources of release within the enclosure.

Downstream of the process seals, any fluids entering the conduit will be at or near atmospheric
pressure. For example, if there is a major release of natural gas into a process building, it is not possible
for significant pressure to develop in the building because the walls and windows will burst at a
relatively low pressure.

There is no need to seal conduit against significant pressure in Class I, Division 1. However, the conduit
itself is required to be in an explosion-proof enclosure; therefore, seals at the boundary of Class I,

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 864



Appendix J
Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

Division 1 locations are required to be explosion-proof to maintain the explosion-proof rating of the
conduit.

In Class I, Division 2, conduit is not required to be explosion-proof and, therefore, boundary seals are
not required to be explosion-proof. They need only be flammable fluid migration seals, i.e., seals for
fluids that are not under pressure. A flammable fluid migration seal can be made using any suitable
fitting that has been filled with a material capable of sufficiently preventing the transmission of the
flammable fluid at or near atmospheric pressure. Properly installed explosion seals are one possible
means of providing a flammable fluid migration seal.

Cables with continuous sheaths will admit fluids only at the point where they terminate in hazardous
areas. Therefore, except in enclosures containing equipment with fluids under pressure, the probability
of flammable fluids entering cables after the process seals is low enough that only a flammable fluid
migration seal is required. In many situations, filling the end of the cable connector where the
conductors exit the connector (or where the conductors exit the cable when the jacket extends beyond
the connector) with silicone or other suitable material will provide an effective flammable fluid
migration seal in Class I, Division 1 and Class I, Division 2. Properly installed explosion-proof, flameproof
“d”, or flameproof “db” cable glands are also a possible means of providing a flammable fluid migration
seal. As flammable fluid migration seals are often not obvious once they are installed, they are required
to be identified. This can be done with a label or tag located near the seals, identifying them as a
“flammable fluid migration seal” and indicating their location if it is not readily apparent.

Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

Δ Rules J18-106, J18-108, J18-152, J18-204 1) b), J18-254 1) b), J18-304, and J18-354
Cables meeting the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 174 are acceptable for use in hazardous locations
and are marked “HL”.

Cables marked for use in hazardous locations are suitable for all locations, but the termination fittings
must be designed for the particular hazardous location. For example, in a Class I, Zone 1 or 2 hazardous
location, a termination fitting entering an enclosure required to be explosion-proof, flameproof “d”, or
flameproof “db” must be a sealing-type termination fitting, whereas a termination fitting entering an
enclosure not required to be explosion-proof, flameproof “d”, or flameproof “db” in a Class I, Zone 2
hazardous location is not required to be marked for use in Class I, Zone 2 hazardous areas. It is intended
that termination fittings in all hazardous areas be compatible with the degree of protection and the
explosion protection provided by the enclosure they enter. In general, the minimum requirement will be
weatherproof termination fittings.

For the application of Annex J18, rigid metal couplings are not considered fittings. The CSA Standard for
rigid metal conduit and couplings is CSA C22.2 No. 45.1. This Standard does not require hazardous
location markings. Certified rigid metal conduit and couplings are suitable for hazardous locations
without specific area classification marking.
Rule J18-106 3)
Where tapered threads are used, the requirement to have 5 fully engaged threads (i.e., threads done up
tight) is critical for the following reasons:
a) When the threads are not fully engaged, the flame path is compromised, making it possible for an

explosion occurring within the conduit system to be transmitted to the area outside the conduit.
b) If there are not 5 fully engaged threads, the flame path may be too short to cool the gases

resulting from an internal explosion to a temperature below that which could ignite gas in the
surrounding area.

c) Because the conduit forms a bonding path to ground, not making the conduit tight will introduce
resistance into the flame path and, if a fault occurs, arcing at the interface may result.

While it may not always be possible to install certain fittings without backing off, it is important to
ensure that the connection is as tight as possible. Properly made conduit connections are critical to the
safety of hazardous location wiring systems.

Δ Rule J18-108
It is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions; otherwise, seals will not function properly to
prevent the transmission of an explosion beyond the seal. Improper sealing has been the primary factor
in a number of explosions, resulting in loss of life and/or major equipment damage. Users are reminded
that only the sealing compound specified in the instructions may be used in a seal. Use of other
manufacturers’ compounds in a seal may compromise the integrity of the installation.

Seals used for intrinsically safe equipment and wiring systems are not required to be explosion-proof
but should be identified for the purpose of minimizing the passage of gases, vapours, or dusts under
normal operating conditions.

All Class I motors and generators are required to have a seal provided by the manufacturer between the
main motor or generator enclosure and the enclosure for the conduit entry (connection box). A marking
regarding the seal being provided is therefore not necessary on this particular class of product.

For cables, compliance with Subrule 4) can be accomplished by
a) a Class I hazardous location cable gland used with the appropriate cable type(s) and a field-

installed sealing fitting;
b) a Class I hazardous location cable gland used with the appropriate cable type(s) with an integral

seal; or

c) a cable gland used with appropriate cable types and with an enclosure provided with sealing as
specified in Subrule 4).

Cable glands with integral seals are marked “SL”.
Δ Rules J18-108 and J18-154

Seals are provided in conduit or cable systems to prevent the passage of gases, vapours, or flames from
one portion of the electrical installation to another through the system.

Some equipment may include markings such as “FACTORY SEALED” or “SEAL NOT REQUIRED” as
permitted by CSA C22.2 No. 30. These terms apply to conduit installations only.

The markings “FACTORY SEALED” and “SEAL NOT REQUIRED” are used interchangeably and indicate that
the termination enclosure for the equipment is isolated from ignition capable components by an
internal factory seal, or that the equipment incorporates devices that have been assessed as not
producing arcs, sparks, or high temperatures.

For equipment marked “FACTORY SEALED” or “SEAL NOT REQUIRED”, the following applies:
a) In Class I, Division 1 applications:

i) For conduit installations, an explosion seal is not required.
ii) For cable installations, an explosion seal is required.

b) In Class I, Division 2 applications, because equipment that is not ignition capable [see
Rule J18-150 2) a)] and terminations housed in non-hazardous location enclosures [see
Rule J18-150 2) c)] are permitted in Class I, Division 2 locations, an explosion seal for conduit or
cable is not required in accordance with Rules J18-154 1) and 4), respectively.

Passage of gases, vapours, or flames through mineral-insulated cable is inherently prevented by the
construction of the cable, but sealing compound is used in cable glands to exclude moisture and other
fluids from the cable insulation and is required to be of a type intended for the conditions of use.

Sealing of conductors in the conduit, or in most cables, requires that the sealing compound completely
surround each individual insulated conductor to ensure that the seal performs its intended function. In
certain constructions of cables, specifically those that contain bundles of shielded pairs, triads, or quads,
removal of the shielding or overall covering from the bundles negates the purpose for which the
shielding was provided. Testing of this type of cable now includes testing for flame propagation along
the length of the individual subassemblies of the cable.

The letters A, B, C, or D, or a combination of them, may be added to signify the group(s) for which the
cable has been tested, for example,
a) the marking “HL-CD” indicates that the cable has been tested for flame propagation for gas groups

C and D; and
b) the marking “TC-BCD” indicates that the cable has been tested for flame propagation for gas

groups B, C, and D.

See also Table JB-3.

Seals are not required for intrinsically safe equipment and wiring systems to prevent the transmission of
an explosion; however, the use of seals for conduit and cable systems is still necessary to prevent the
migration of the flammable atmosphere from one zone of a hazardous location to another or from a
hazardous to non-hazardous location.

Δ Rule J18-108 1)
Seals are required on conduit systems where a conduit enters an enclosure not required to be
explosion-proof, flameproof “d”, or flameproof “db” (typically an increased safety “e” or increased
safety “eb” enclosure) because the conduit system is required to be maintained as an explosion-proof,

Appendix J
Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

flameproof “d”, or flameproof “db” wiring system in a Class I, Zone 1 hazardous location. The conduit
entry into an increased safety “e” or increased safety “eb” enclosure must also meet the ingress
protection rating of the enclosure.

Δ Rules J18-108 1) and J18-154 1)
Field machining of conduit openings is allowed in enclosures where indicated by the manufacturer’s
instructions, provided that they are carried out in accordance with those instructions. The restriction for
sealing field-machined entries within 50 mm is to address any variations in the quality of work. Other
entries may be acceptable but must be performed by a competent machining facility in accordance with
the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 30.

Δ Rules J18-108 6) and J18-154 3)
Conduit fittings for use in Class I locations and similar to the “L”, “T”, or “Cross” type are not usually
classed as enclosures when not larger than the trade size of the conduit.

Reducers may have one side larger than the trade size of the conduit where the entry to the explosion-
proof, flameproof “d”, or flameproof “db” enclosure is larger than the trade size of the conduit.

Δ Rules J18-108 8) and J18-154 4)
Cables and flexible cords are not tested to determine their ability to resist internal explosions.
Therefore, regardless of size, each cable must be sealed at the point of entry into any enclosure that is
required to be explosion-proof.

Some designs of cable glands incorporate an integral seal and these are marked “SL” to indicate that the
seal is provided by the cable gland. Cable glands of this type are identified with the class designation.
Designs requiring a field- or factory-installed sealing fitting have the group designation marked on this
component.

Because the appropriate sealing characteristics may be achieved by different means, the manufacturer’s
instructions should be followed.
Rules J18-114 and J18-150
Users are cautioned that combining a variable frequency drive (VFD) with a motor may increase the
operating temperature of the motor as a result of the harmonics produced by the drive. This may cause
the motor temperature to exceed its temperature code rating. This is of particular concern where the
operating temperature of the motor is close to the ignition temperature of hazardous materials that
may be in the area. Because of the generally lower ignition temperatures associated with Class II
materials, it will be of particular concern in Class II areas. It remains the responsibility of the user to
ensure that the operating temperature of the motor, in combination with the drive, is below the
minimum ignition temperature of the hazardous material in the area. The motor manufacturer should
be consulted where necessary. The following are some references that may assist the user in
determining the suitability of an installation:
a) API RP 2216, Ignition Risk of Hydrocarbon Liquids and Vapors by Hot Surfaces in the Open Air; and
b) IEEE Paper No. PCIC-97-04, “Flammable Vapor Ignition Initiated By Hot Rotor Surfaces Within an

Induction Motor — Reality or Not?”.
Rule J18-116
Gas turbines in hazardous locations also need safeguards against potential hazards from other than
electrical ignition systems, such as exhaust and fuel systems. The complete engine assembly should be
investigated for its suitability in Class I, Division 1 hazardous locations.

Δ Rule J18-150 2) d)
Fuses functioning in response to short-circuit conditions is considered an abnormal operating condition
and has a very low frequency of occurrence compared to fuses which are installed in circuits where, in
addition to short-circuit conditions, they may function as a result of overload conditions. Fixed loads,
such as lighting loads, would be unlikely to produce an overload condition in normal operation, but a
motor subjected to variable mechanical loads offers the added possibility of overload. Where fuses are

Rule J18-150 2) e)
See the Note to Rules J18-114 and J18-150.

Rotating electrical machines of the open or non-explosion-proof type do not have a certification
Standard for Class I, Division 2. This Subrule provides the criteria for applying, in Division 2, rotating
electrical machines that do not have a certification suitable for Division 2. Refer to IEEE 1349 for more
detailed information on applying these rotating electrical machines in Class I, Division 2 locations.
Rule J18-150 3)
These heaters may not be designed for hazardous locations. They are considered suitable on the basis
that they are contained within the motor or generator and are therefore mechanically protected, do not
use temperature controls (to eliminate heater temperature runaway in the event of a controls failure),
and are non-ignition-capable under normal operating conditions.

Δ Rule J18-150 4)
The evaluation process to determine if the sliding contact shaft bonding device is non-incendive is found

The person taking responsibility for the calculation is normally an engineering professional or other
individual permitted to practise engineering.

Liquid-tight flexible metal conduit and associated connectors intended for use in hazardous locations
are marked “HEAVY DUTY” or “HD”.
Rule J18-152 7)
Cable glands should be compatible with the degree of ingress protection and explosion protection
provided by the enclosure on which they are installed.

For example, to maintain the protection of an enclosure required to be explosion-proof, a sealing-type
gland marked for the location should be used. Where unarmoured cables must enter an enclosure
required to be explosion-proof, a combination of a sealing fitting marked for the location and a non-
sealing cable gland may be used.

Where equipment normally considered suitable for use in ordinary locations is acceptable in Division 2
locations, such as terminal boxes and motors, ordinary location cable glands that maintain the degree of
protection of the enclosure may be used. Similarly, where purged enclosures are used in Division 1 and
Division 2 locations, ordinary location cable glands that maintain the degree of protection of the
enclosure may be used.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 872



Appendix J
Rules and Notes to Rules for installations using the

CSA C22.1:21 Class and Division system of classification

Where equipment is specifically designed for use in Division 2 locations, ordinary location cable glands
that maintain the degree of protection of the enclosure may be used. One means of achieving
equivalent protection is the use of a cable gland with the same or better IP rating as the enclosure (see
Table B18-6). If the gland does not have an IP rating, other ratings, such as weatherproof, may be
matched to the enclosure rating.

Δ Rule J18-154 2) b)
This Subrule allows the seal at the boundary between an outdoor Class I, Division 2 location and an
outdoor non-hazardous location to be located farther than 300 mm from the boundary of the Class I,
Division 2 location, provided that it is located on the conduit prior to it entering an enclosure or a
building. Because gas is present in Class I, Division 2 locations only for short periods, it is unlikely that
gas or vapour could be released through conduit couplings at sufficiently high rates to form an explosive
gas atmosphere in outdoor areas. However, the seal must be located on the conduit before it enters an
enclosure or a building because, depending on the ventilation rate, gas transmitted through the conduit
may build up to flammable concentrations.

Because overheated windings of large pipe-ventilated motors (or fire in these motors) are not readily
detected by odour or smoke, it is advisable, especially in the case of buildings not provided with
automatic sprinklers, to take the following precautions:
a) if ventilation air is supplied from a separate source, an air-pressure-operated switch should

supervise the supply of air and be arranged to shut down the pipe-ventilated motor in case of air
failure;

b) an automatic fire detector should be placed at the air discharge end of the pipe-ventilated motor
and be arranged to shut down the motor if overheating or fire should occur;

c) a port with a self-closing shutter should be provided at the motor air intake end to facilitate
discharge into the motor frame of a fire extinction medium;

d) to complement Item c), fire dampers fitted with fusible links should be provided for the air intake
and discharge ends of the motor to confine fire and the fire extinction medium to the motor
frame;

e) intake and discharge ducts should be carefully installed with respect to combustible construction or
storage and should not pierce firewalls, fire partitions, floors, or ceilings unless provided with
automatic fire shutters or dampers where they pierce the fire section or division of the building
(see NFPA 91); and

f) intake and discharge ducts should be kept clear of accumulation of combustible lint or dust.

Rule J20-100
This Rule applies to areas where vehicles that use fuels classified as flammable liquids are repaired or
serviced. It does not apply to areas where vehicles burning combustible liquids such as diesel fuel are
repaired or serviced. Table JB-4 lists the flash points of combustible and flammable liquids as
determined by the methods specified in NFPA 30:

Table JB-4
Flash points of combustible and flammable liquids determined

in accordance with NFPA 30

Liquid classification Closed-cup flash point
Flammable liquid (Class I liquid)* Less than 37.8 °C
Combustible liquid (Class II liquid) Not less than 37.8 °C and less than 60 °C
Combustible liquid (Class IIIA liquid) Not less than 60 °C and less than 93 °C
Combustible liquid (Class IIIB liquid) Not less than 93 °C

* Class I liquids are further subdivided into Classes IA, IB, and IC.

Flash point is typically used to determine if the possibility of a liquid being released into the air requires
the area to be classified as a hazardous location. If a liquid is stored or used in an area at temperatures
below its flash point, the area may be classified as a non-hazardous area.

Appendix K — Extract from IEC 60364-1

Chapter 13
Notes:
1) This Appendix is an informative (non-mandatory) part of this Code.
2) This extract is reprinted from IEC 60364-1 with permission.

13 Fundamental principles
Notes:
1) Where countries not yet having national regulations for electrical installations deem it necessary to establish

legal requirements for this purpose, it is recommended that such requirements be limited to fundamental
principles which are not subject to frequent modification on account of technical development. The contents
of Clause 13 may be used as a basis for such legislation.

2) This clause contains basic requirements. In other parts of this standard (see Table A.2), more detailed
requirements may be given.

131 Protection for safety
131.1 General
The requirements stated in 131.2 to 131.7 are intended to provide for the safety of persons, livestock
and property against dangers and damage which may arise in the reasonable use of electrical
installations. The requirements to provide for the safety of livestock are applicable in locations intended
for them.
Note: In electrical installations, the following hazards may arise:
— shock currents;
— excessive temperatures likely to cause burns, fires and other injurious effects;
— ignition of a potentially explosive atmosphere;
— undervoltages, overvoltages and electromagnetic influences likely to cause or result in injury or damage;
— power supply interruptions and/or interruption of safety services;
— arcing, likely to cause blinding effects, excessive pressure, and/or toxic gases;
— mechanical movement of electrically activated equipment.

131.2 Protection against electric shock
131.2.1 Basic protection (protection against direct contact)
Note: For low-voltage installations, systems and equipment, basic protection generally corresponds to protection
against direct contact.

Protection shall be provided against dangers that may arise from contact with live parts of the
installation by persons or livestock.

This protection can be achieved by one of the following methods:

— preventing a current from passing through the body of any person or any livestock;

— limiting the current which can pass through a body to a non-hazardous value.

131.2.2 Fault protection (protection against indirect contact)
Note: For low-voltage installations, systems and equipment, fault protection generally corresponds to protection
against indirect contact, mainly with regard to failure of basic insulation.

Protection shall be provided against dangers that may arise from contact with exposed-conductive-parts
of the installation by persons or livestock.

Appendix K
CSA C22.1:21 Extract from IEC 60364-1

This protection can be achieved by one of the following methods:

— preventing a current resulting from a fault from passing through the body of any person or any
livestock;

— limiting the magnitude of a current resulting from a fault, which can pass through a body, to a non-
hazardous value;

— limiting the duration of a current resulting from a fault, which can pass through a body, to a non-
hazardous time period.

131.3 Protection against thermal effects
The electrical installation shall be so arranged to minimize the risk of damage or ignition of flammable
materials due to high temperature or electric arc. In addition, during normal operation of the electrical
equipment, there shall be no risk of persons or livestock suffering burns.

131.4 Protection against overcurrent
Persons and livestock shall be protected against injury and property shall be protected against damage
due to excessive temperatures or electromechanical stresses caused by any overcurrents likely to arise
in conductors.

Protection can be achieved by limiting the overcurrent to a safe value or duration.

131.5 Protection against fault currents
Conductors, other than live conductors, and any other parts intended to carry a fault current shall be
capable of carrying that current without attaining an excessive temperature. Electrical equipment,
including conductors shall be provided with mechanical protection against electromechanical stresses of
fault currents as necessary to prevent injury or damage to persons, livestock or property.

Live conductors shall be protected against overcurrents arising from faults by the methods in 131.4.
Note: Particular attention should be given to PE conductor and earthing conductor currents.

131.6 Protection against voltage disturbances and measures against electromagnetic
influences
131.6.1 Persons and livestock shall be protected against injury and property shall be protected against
any harmful effects as a consequence of a fault between live parts of circuits supplied at different
voltages.

131.6.2 Persons and livestock shall be protected against injury and property shall be protected against
damage as a consequence of overvoltages such as those originating from atmospheric events or from
switching.
Note: For protection against direct lightning strikes, see IEC 62305 series.

131.6.3 Persons and livestock shall be protected against injury and property shall be protected against
damage as a consequence of undervoltage and any subsequent voltage recovery.

131.6.4 The installation shall have an adequate level of immunity against electromagnetic disturbances
so as to function correctly in the specified environment. The installation design shall take into
consideration the anticipated electromagnetic emissions, generated by the installation or the installed
equipment, which shall be suitable for the current-using equipment used with, or connected to, the
installation.

132.2.3 Values and tolerances:

— voltage and voltage tolerances;

— voltage interruptions, voltage fluctuations and voltage dips;

— frequency and frequency tolerances;

— maximum current allowable;

— earth fault loop impedance upstream of the origin of the installation;

— prospective short-circuit currents.

For standard voltages and frequencies, see IEC 60038.

132.2.4 Protective provisions inherent in the supply, for example, system earthing or midpoint
earthing.

132.2.5 Particular requirements of the supply undertaking.

— Circuits to be supplied by the electric source for safety services or the standby electrical source.

132.5 Environmental conditions
The design of the electrical installation shall take into account the environmental conditions to which it
will be subjected, see IEC 60364-5-51 and IEC 60721.

132.6 Cross-sectional area of conductors
The cross-sectional area of conductors shall be determined for both normal operating conditions and
for fault conditions according to
a) their admissible maximum temperature;
b) the admissible voltage drop;
c) the electromechanical stresses likely to occur due to earth fault and short-circuit currents;
d) other mechanical stresses to which the conductors can be subjected;
e) the maximum impedance with respect to the functioning of the protection against fault currents;
f) the method of installation.
Note: The items listed above concern primarily the safety of electrical installations. Cross-sectional areas greater
than those required for safety may be desirable for economic operation.

132.7 Type of wiring and methods of installation
For the choice of the type of wiring and the methods of installation the following shall be taken into
account:

— the nature of the locations;

— the nature of the walls or other parts of the building supporting the wiring;

— accessibility of wiring to persons and livestock;

— voltage;

— the electromagnetic stresses likely to occur due to earth fault and short-circuit currents;

— electromagnetic interference;

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 888



Appendix K
CSA C22.1:21 Extract from IEC 60364-1

— other stresses to which the wiring can be subjected during the erection of the electrical installation
or in service.

132.8 Protective equipment
The characteristics of protective equipment shall be determined with respect to their function which
may be, for example, protection against the effects of

— overcurrent (overload, short-circuit);

— earth fault current;

— overvoltage;

— undervoltage and no voltage.

The protective devices shall operate at values of current, voltage and time which are suitably related to
the characteristics of the circuits and to the possibilities of danger.

132.9 Emergency control
Where, in case of danger, there is the necessity for the immediate interruption of supply, an
interrupting device shall be installed in such a way that it can be easily recognized and effectively and
rapidly operated.

132.10 Disconnecting devices

Appendix K
CSA C22.1:21 Extract from IEC 60364-1

133.2 Characteristics
Every item of electrical equipment selected shall have suitable characteristics appropriate to the values
and conditions on which the design of the electrical installation (see Clause 132) is based and shall, in
particular, fulfil the following requirements.

133.2.1 Voltage
Electrical equipment shall be suitable with respect to the maximum steady-state voltage (r.m.s. value for
a.c.) likely to be applied, as well as overvoltages likely to occur.
Note: For certain equipment, it may be necessary to take account of the lowest voltage likely to occur.

133.2.2 Current
All electrical equipment shall be selected with respect to the maximum steady-state current (r.m.s. value
for a.c.) which it has to carry in normal service, and with respect to the current likely to be carried in
abnormal conditions and the period (for example, operating time of protective devices, if any) during
which it may be expected to flow.

133.2.3 Frequency
If frequency has an influence on the characteristics of electrical equipment, the rated frequency of the
equipment shall correspond to the frequency likely to occur in the circuit.

133.2.4 Load factor
All electrical equipment which is selected on the basis of its power characteristics shall be suitable for
the duty demanded of the equipment taking into account the design service conditions, see
IEV 691-10-02.

133.3 Conditions of installation
All electrical equipment shall be selected so as to withstand safely the stresses and the environmental
conditions (see 132.5) characteristic of its location and to which it may be subjected. If, however, an
item of equipment does not have by design the properties corresponding to its location, it may be used
on condition that adequate additional protection is provided as part of the completed electrical
installation.

133.4 Prevention of harmful effects
All electrical equipment shall be selected so that it will not cause harmful effects on other equipment or
impair the supply during normal service including switching operations. In this context, the factors
which can have an influence include, for example:

— power factor;

— inrush current;

— asymmetrical load;

— harmonics;

— transient overvoltages generated by equipment in the installation.

134 Erection and verification of electrical installations
134.1 Erection
134.1.1 Good workmanship by competent persons and proper materials shall be used in the erection
of the electrical installation. Electrical equipment shall be installed in accordance with the instructions
provided by the manufacturer of the equipment.

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 890

Appendix L
Engineering guidelines for determining

CSA C22.1:21 hazardous area classifications

Appendix L — Engineering guidelines for determining
hazardous area classifications

Note: This Appendix is an informative (non-mandatory) part of this Code.
L1 Scope
This Appendix provides guidance for the determination of hazardous areas in facilities where explosive
atmospheres can occur.

Explosive gas atmospheres can exist in the exploration for and production and transportation of crude
oil, natural gas, and related hydrocarbons and in other facilities such as petrochemical plants, refineries,
and distilleries.

Explosive dust atmospheres can exist in a variety of industries, including food, plastics, lumber, rubber,
furniture, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and dyes, and in coal, metals, and fossil fuel generation.

Area classification codes, standards, and recommended practices do not address catastrophic release
situations [see API RP 505 1.2.1(b)]. Other procedures and response plans should be put in place by
facility operators to address these possibilities.
Note: This Appendix is not intended as a mandatory code for developing area classifications.
L2 Intent
The intent of this Appendix is to provide an overview of the most common considerations that should
be addressed in performing an area classification. This Appendix is also intended to promote awareness
of the various industry codes, standards, and recommended practices that can be used as resources in
performing area classification studies. These references provide extensive information applicable to
conditions commonly encountered in many types of facilities in Canadian industries where explosive
atmospheres can be present. Proper application of these codes, standards, and recommended practices
in any given situation requires knowledge and experience.
L3 Stakeholders
This Appendix is focused on engineering and design requirements essential for proper area classification
but also identifies requirements that affect other stakeholders, such as original equipment
manufacturers, installers, inspectors, and operations, safety, and maintenance personnel. There are also
other stakeholders, such as insurers or regulatory representatives responsible for worker safety or code
enforcement, who may be impacted by an area classification or require access to documentation
related to it.
L4 Factors used to determine an area classification
Electrical designs and installations in hazardous locations are based on the area classifications for a
facility. The factors to be taken into account in defining an area classification include the following:
a) the characteristics of the fluids being handled (e.g., chemical and physical properties such as flash

point, molar composition, liquid density, vapour specific gravity, lower flammable limit (LFL), upper
flammable limit (UFL), mole weight);

b) operating pressures, temperatures, flow rates, and volumes;
c) the design and maintenance of the compression, pumping, piping, valve, and containment systems

for handling the fluids;
d) the minimum explosible concentration of dusts;
e) dust confinement systems;
f) housekeeping and humidity;
g) building design and dimensions;
h) heating and ventilation systems in buildings;
i) the site layout and proximity to other structures;
j) the type of safety systems available (e.g., gas detection);

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 892



Appendix L
Engineering guidelines for determining

CSA C22.1:21 hazardous area classifications

k) outdoor terrain and topographical features (e.g., berms, low spots, slopes, vegetation);
l) local temperature and wind conditions;
m) the remoteness of an installation (i.e., the capacity to detect and/or respond to a release through

on-site personnel or remote monitoring);
n) operating and maintenance practices and training;
o) the operating, maintenance, and failure history of the facility; and
p) facility modifications resulting from site operations or maintenance that could impact the area

classification boundaries.
L5 Multidisciplinary involvement
Many of the factors given as examples in Clause L4 are best understood by disciplines other than
electrical engineers and designers. These disciplines may include
a) process engineers;
b) heating and ventilation engineers;
c) air quality scientists or engineers;
d) operations specialists;
e) fire and safety specialists;
f) maintenance personnel; and
g) instrumentation engineers.

Decisions about the involvement of personnel from various disciplines, and the timing and level of that
involvement, should be based on corporate policies and/or made by engineering staff, based on the
scope and complexity of the project. The individual leading the area classification study should be
knowledgeable and competent in the principles of area classification.
L6 Responsibility for training and competence
The engineering profession is responsible for determining what levels of competence are required for a
given discipline or activity. There is currently no regulated certification requirement verifying
competence for an engineer in order to perform an area classification study. There is, nonetheless, a
professional responsibility on the part of the practising engineer to be knowledgeable and competent in
practising the profession, hence in performing an area classification study.

The following are various approaches that can be taken to develop competence in performing area
classification studies:
a) taking industry-sponsored training on area classification techniques;
b) certification to IECEx OD 504, IEC System for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for

Use in Explosive Atmospheres (IECEx System) — IECEx Scheme for Certification of Personnel
Competence for Explosive Atmospheres — Specification for Units of Competence Assessment
Outcomes;

c) participation in codes and Standards development organizations (SDOs);
d) mentorship by more experienced engineers;
e) familiarization with codes and standards;
f) on-the-job performance of area classification studies (under appropriate supervision), starting with

simple installations and moving towards more complex installations;
g) reviewing existing area classification studies;
h) reviewing incident and failure histories;
i) participating in investigations and corrective or remedial projects; and
j) developing and delivering area classification training programs.
L7 Engineering authentication
Where an engineer is involved, all area classification drawings and studies should be traceable to a
registered professional engineer working under a permit to practise. Traceability and authentication

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 893



Appendix L
Engineering guidelines for determining

CSA C22.1:21 hazardous area classifications

requirements are governed by the respective jurisdiction, but typically this means that drawings and
reports are signed and stamped, or signed with the title P. Eng. (or equivalent).
L8 Engineering quality controls
In addition to competency and training of the individual professional engineer, the engineering project
structure should also include peer or supervisory reviews of area classification documents.
L9 Documentation and records
Area classification drawings and supporting studies should be maintained on file with the owner/
operator of the facility for the life of the facility and any additional legally required time period
thereafter. The professional engineer and/or engineering company that prepared the reports and
drawings should also maintain those records in accordance with any regulatory and/or contractually
required time periods. These records should be accessible, upon request, by any affected stakeholder.

In order to ensure accessibility and facilitate retrieval, all relevant information should be recorded on
the area classification drawing itself (e.g., results of fugitive emissions studies with date or revision
number, minimum ventilation rates, rationales, process conditions, and any other important
comments). See also Clause L12.

Company-specific operating and safety procedures may require on-site access to, or posting of, area
classification drawings for convenient reference. Such drawings should, therefore, be well organized,
uncluttered, and easy to understand.
L10 Management of change
Area classification studies and drawings are based on certain assumptions and conditions. If process or
operating conditions change (e.g., as a result of plant expansions, equipment relocations, changes in
inlet or process streams, changes in operating pressures, changes in operating procedures, alteration of
building ventilation, or changes in site grading), or if conditions are not maintained (e.g., gas detection
is not kept in proper working order), then the area classification may be rendered invalid. Depending
upon the exact nature of the changes, this may lead to an unsafe condition. A management-of-change
process should be put in place to ensure that the area classification remains valid and is adhered to at
all times throughout the life of a facility.

A management-of-change process may require changes such as the following:
a) revisions to area classification studies and drawings;
b) modifications of designs and installations; and
c) changes to procedures.

All documentation sets should be updated, and all stakeholders should be notified of the changes and
potential impacts.

Appropriate engineering review and sign-off should be part of a management-of-change process.
Engineering accountability is present not only for the initial project design, but also throughout the life
of a facility.
L11 Communication responsibilities
As noted, area classification studies are based on various conditions and assumptions that must be valid
if the determination of area classification is to be valid. At the outset of a project, the engineer
responsible should communicate these conditions and assumptions to all parties (e.g., construction,
inspection, operating, and maintenance personnel) responsible for ensuring that these requirements
are met during the initial installation and throughout the life of the facility. The following are examples
of methods of communication and design approaches:
a) including area classification studies in project data books;
b) including appropriate notes on drawings;
c) holding training sessions;
d) requiring various warning signs in and around classified areas;

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 894



Appendix L
Engineering guidelines for determining

CSA C22.1:21 hazardous area classifications

e) requiring the posting of area classification drawings and/or studies that present key information;
f) requiring classification signs for building interiors;
g) requiring fencing or barriers to restrict access to the site;
h) requiring equipment that will help to ensure conformance (e.g., travel stops on the louvres of dust

collection or confinement systems); and
i) mandatory housekeeping procedures.
L12 Drawing requirements
L12.1 General
Area classification drawing sets typically consist of combinations of site plans, elevation or sectional
views, details, and clarifying notes. The drawings show the indoor and outdoor zone classifications in
and around a facility, using standard cross-hatching. There are usually installation details for specific
equipment configurations, and some aspects of the facility may have to be represented in greater detail
(e.g., process or instrumentation vents, pig traps, or dust collection or confinement systems). See
API RP 500 and RP 505 for examples of area classification drawings.

Key area classification supporting information, assumptions, and conditions included on drawings
should be presented in an orderly and concise manner so that the drawings remain clear and can be
readily understood. One approach that can be used to accomplish this is to put essential information on
the drawings, along with references to more detailed information to be found in other documents. See
Clauses L12.2 and L12.3 for examples of the types of information that may be appropriate.

Engineered drawings may be either typical drawings or site-specific custom drawings, depending on the
complexity of the situation. For simple installations, such as stand-alone pumpjacks or wellheads, typical
drawings from company standards may be used, rather than individual site-specific drawings for each
small facility. Typical drawings should be used only when they accurately represent the installation.
Complex facilities typically have site-specific engineering drawing sets.
L12.2 Basic information
Drawings should include the following types of basic information:
a) area classification information, such as classes, zones, groupings, and maximum allowable surface

operating temperatures for electrical equipment;
b) legends explaining the various cross-hatchings used on the diagrams (based on IEC

recommendations);
c) diagrams showing the extent of the various zones;
d) assumptions, notes, and conditions;
e) site locations, professional engineering stamps, and other title block information; and
f) bar scales embedded in the drawing that automatically scale with the drawing when it is printed

out on different sizes of paper.
L12.3 Supporting information, assumptions, and conditions
Key supporting information, assumptions, and conditions may include documentation of the following,
as appropriate:
a) references to file numbers, dates, and authors’ names for supporting area classification studies;
b) reference to documentation on composition and physical property parameters of process fluids

(e.g., mole weight, relative density, lower flammable limit, upper flammable limit, auto-ignition
temperatures, volume or molar compositions);

c) operating conditions such as pressures, flow rates, or volumes (these may be specific point values
or ranges if the area classification was performed for a range of conditions);

d) calculation methods (e.g., API RP 505, Appendix B) with supporting data and assumptions;
e) hydrocarbon leakage rates (including references used);
f) fresh air introduction rates;
g) safety factors assumed;

January 2021 © 2021 Canadian Standards Association 895



Appendix L
Engineering guidelines for determining

CSA C22.1:21 hazardous area classifications

h) internal and external ambient temperatures (point or range values);
i) minimum natural or forced ventilation rates;
j) louvre sizing and/or travel stop settings;
k) text and layout for warning signs or labels;
l) combustible gas detection provisions, including requirements for sensors, locations, and alarm and

shutdown actions;
Note: Some of this information may be communicated in shutdown keys.

m) vapour-tight sealing requirements for walls or other barriers;
n) purging and/or pressurization requirements; and
o) warnings to review and update studies and drawings when conditions deviate from those specified.
L13 Inspection requirements
Field and shop inspectors should be provided with the engineered area classification studies and
drawings applicable to the facility to be inspected.
L14 Selected references and information sources
L14.1 General
There are numerous references and information sources that can be used in preparing an area
classification. Clauses L14.2 and L14.3 list some of the most commonly used resources, with notes
where applicable about the information that can be obtained from them.
L14.2 Selected references
